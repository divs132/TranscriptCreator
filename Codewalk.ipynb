We will be looking looking at the introduction. so we need to understand that heightened programming East, open sauce, Right, and it is a generalized programming language and it is used for a Gengeneric purpose and Rick papers, and also Piton programming is scalable and it is inter active as well, and there are also other other capabilities. When it comes to Piton. it is we call it at a high level programming language. as we generally. we'll call it as highly will programming language. And it is so his independent meaning. Now it is portable. it can be used in different operating system. It supports different operating systems, and and there are different ones of benefits when we talk about fighting programming physically, it is. it acts like a medium. It, it acts like a medium of communication. What you communicate. your computer understands what you try to what you try to communicate, and process the data. Oke. When we talk about Piton, we should also know about the history of Piton. Can we should also know about the history of Piton, and also we need to understand how Piton was originated, Right who originated Piton and or how pits originator. There is the sky. A gentleman, Sid, fine rose, A, he's Dutch. This gentleman Rassam started developing Piton way back in Nineteen eighty Nine and I, Peyton was officially released or introduced in Auron Nineteen ninety one, one February, look here, and Peyton was made open sauced in and around the same year. If I'm not wrong, it was. It was open sauced in and around Nineteen ninety one itself. I, So we need to understand. We spoke about fighting being open souls. Right, so we need to understand. What what do we mean by open schools? What do we mean by open souls? We know that it is for free. Right, it is available for free that we understand, and when when we say free and open souls, it is not only the feature. it is not only about Piton being or available for free. There are other other other aspects also to being open souls. Let me let me talk about or let me now. give an example where I would like to put you in a hypothetical situation. Oke. let us say you have created a soft war. Make a person a created a soft ware, and you want to develop the soft ware. You know, initially, when you started off with the soft ware with the application, it is just an idea, right. it is just an idea. You have a soft air. You. you want you want to devil up that soft soft war further right And then at this stage, I would say is the beginning of it and you have a long way to go right. So when you're developing a soft fair, you have two options. One is commercializing it, or make it an open source, open source that is available for all the uses when it comes to commercializing this of fair. What you do is you introduce it to the market and you sell it. You have a particular clients, a bunch of clients who will make money, who will invest, and they've developed, and you, also that there's also money involved in it. Ultimately you'll get rich right, but also there is another option, bridges, or benzol, which is available enough for free handed, a bunch of fur or ment of people developing your soft lips.\n"

      "[\"GOOD MORNING EVERY ONE LET US GET STARTED WITH OUR PATENT PROGRAMMING SESSION TO DAY WE WILL BE DISCUSSING ABOUT PATENT PROGRAMMING WE WILL LOOKING WE WILL BE LOOKING LOOKING AT THE INTRODUCTION  SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT HEIGHTENED PROGRAMMING EAST OPEN SAUCE RIGHT AND IT IS A GENERALIZED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND IT IS USED FOR A GENGENERIC PURPOSE AND RICK PAPERS AND ALSO PITON PROGRAMMING IS SCALABLE AND IT IS INTER ACTIVE AS WELL AND THERE ARE ALSO OTHER OTHER CAPABILITIES WHEN IT COMES TO PITON IT IS WE CALL IT AT A HIGH LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AS WE  GENERALLY WE'LL CALL IT AS HIGHLY WILL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE AND IT IS SO HIS INDEPENDENT MEANING NOW IT IS PORTABLE  IT CAN BE USED IN DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEM IT SUPPORTS DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS AND AND THERE ARE DIFFERENT ONES OF BENEFITS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FIGHTING PROGRAMMING PHYSICALLY IT IS IT ACTS LIKE A MEDIUM IT IT ACTS LIKE A MEDIUM OF COMMUNICATION WHAT YOU COMMUNICATE YOUR COMPUTER UNDERSTANDS WHAT YOU TRY TO WHAT YOU TRY TO COMMUNICATE AND PROCESS THE DATA OKE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PITON WE SHOULD ALSO KNOW ABOUT THE HISTORY OF PITON CAN WE SHOULD ALSO KNOW ABOUT THE HISTORY OF PITON AND ALSO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW PITON WAS ORIGINATED RIGHT  WHO ORIGINATED PITON AND OR HOW PITS ORIGINATOR THERE IS THE SKY A GENTLEMAN SID FINE ROSE A HE'S DUTCH THIS GENTLEMAN RASSAM STARTED DEVELOPING PITON WAY BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND I PEYTON WAS OFFICIALLY RELEASED OR INTRODUCED IN AURON NINETEEN NINETY ONE ONE FEBRUARY LOOK HERE AND PEYTON WAS MADE OPEN SAUCED IN AND AROUND THE SAME YEAR IF I'M NOT WRONG IT WAS IT WAS OPEN SAUCED IN AND AROUND NINETEEN NINETY ONE ITSELF I SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WE SPOKE ABOUT FIGHTING BEING OPEN SOULS RIGHT SO WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WHAT DO WE MEAN BY OPEN SCHOOLS WHAT DO WE MEAN BY OPEN SOULS WE KNOW THAT IT IS FOR FREE RIGHT IT IS AVAILABLE FOR FREE THAT WE UNDERSTAND AND WHEN WHEN WE SAY FREE AND OPEN SOULS IT IS NOT ONLY THE FEATURE IT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT PITON BEING OR AVAILABLE FOR FREE THERE ARE OTHER OTHER OTHER ASPECTS ALSO TO BEING OPEN SOULS LET ME LET ME TALK ABOUT OR LET ME NOW GIVE AN EXAMPLE WHERE I WOULD LIKE TO PUT YOU IN A HYPOTHETICAL SITUATION OKE LET US SAY YOU HAVE CREATED A SOFT WAR MAKE A PERSON A CREATED A SOFT WARE AND YOU WANT TO DEVELOP THE SOFT WARE YOU KNOW INITIALLY WHEN YOU STARTED OFF WITH THE SOFT WARE WITH THE APPLICATION IT IS JUST AN IDEA RIGHT IT IS JUST AN IDEA YOU HAVE A SOFT AIR YOU YOU WANT YOU WANT TO DEVIL UP THAT SOFT SOFT WAR FURTHER RIGHT AND THEN AT THIS STAGE I WOULD SAY IS THE BEGINNING OF IT AND YOU HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO RIGHT SO WHEN YOU'RE DEVELOPING A SOFT FAIR YOU HAVE TWO OPTIONS ONE IS COMMERCIALIZING IT OR MAKE IT AN OPEN SOURCE OPEN SOURCE THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR ALL THE USES WHEN IT COMES TO COMMERCIALIZING THIS OF FAIR WHAT YOU DO IS YOU INTRODUCE IT TO THE MARKET AND YOU SELL IT YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR CLIENTS A BUNCH OF CLIENTS WHO WILL MAKE MONEY WHO WILL INVEST AND THEY'VE DEVELOPED AND YOU ALSO THAT THERE'S ALSO MONEY INVOLVED IN IT ULTIMATELY YOU'LL GET RICH RIGHT BUT ALSO THERE IS ANOTHER OPTION BRIDGES OR BENZOL WHICH IS AVAILABLE ENOUGH FOR FREE HANDED A BUNCH OF FUR OR MENT OF PEOPLE DEVELOPING YOUR SOFT LIPS\", \"DOES ANY ONE WANT TO SEE YER STEVE FEED BACK FROM THE SPECIFICATION IS THERE MUCH MORE IN IT THAN HIS WAS THERE MUCH MORE IN IT THAN YOU SAID YESTERDAY NOT REALLY WAS TALKING ABOUT DUPLICATION OF EFFORT LIKE DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND STUFF AND YES I KNOW SHE MAY BE A THINK ABOUT HAVING A PROTO TATER WEAK SEX WHICH IS NAE SO I ROEPER OH YES I SAY IF FOR THE PROTOTYPE FATALITE WHEREVER POSSIBLE CHANT THE STUFF THAT WE HAVE A PRE ANETA TO STUFF AND FOR THE STUFF THAT WE DON'T PRE ANETTE RIGHT LIKE TUBE PLACE LINE THEN WE SHOULD PROBABLY BE ABLE TO RESIDE THAT WE BE FOCUS ON ON THE INTER FACE FIRST TO US SO THAT WE WE TAKE THE THE READY MADE PARTS AND JUST SEE HOW WE GET THE WORD TO GET IN ANTIPAS THE WAY WE WANT THEN WE HAVE A WORK IN PROTOTYPE ND THEN WE CAN GO BACK AND REPLACE PIECES EITHER BY OUR OWN COMPONENTS OR BY MORE SOPHISTICATE CON COMONENTS OF OUR OWN IT PROBABLY FELT THINGS EM AWAY THIS WEEK AND SO IF WE JUST WANT TO HAVE EM SOME TATE FOR THE USE FACE COULD I BE RANDOM LATER OH YE YE KNOW BOUT I MIGHT LIKE THE THE SIMILARITY SINTIMIUST M MATRICES ITSELF FOR MY STUFF I I I THINK I CAN DO THAT FAYE BECAUSE I HAVE THE WELL GO BACK FIRST TO A LOOK AT NIECKSMELL TO SEE IN HOW FAR THAT THAT WHICH WE WANT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THAT WITH NIGHT A SMELL OFFERS US AND THEN JUST SORT OF EVERY ONE MAKES SURE EVERY ONE UNDERSTANDS THE INTERFACE SO I THINK IF TO DAY WE DECIDE ON WHAT DATA WE WANT TO HAVE NOW AND LATER MAY BE EVEN TO DAY WE GO AND LOOK AT NIGHT EXETER SOME OF US TO A NIGHT EXPEDITION TATOES TRYING TO MAKE SOME TEN SOCOTAND SEE HOW DOES THE PENTATION WORK THE END AND THEN SOOTHE KNOWLEDGE WE TOTAL TO AN SAY AT THAT TO NIGHT COME DATA WE WANT A LOAD INTO IT AND THIS IS HOW EVERY ONE AN ACCESS IT AND THEN E USEABLE O O HOO O O O O O L I LOOK LOOK THE DOCUMENTATION AND I SEEN ENOUGH TO MAKE ME THINK THAT WE WANT TO USE THE NIGHT EMARINE WORK BECAUSE THEY HAVE GOT THE MOLE THAT INCREASE THE SORT THE DATA AND IN EVERY DISPLAY HAVANA TAKES A LOT OF WORK AWAY FROM US SORT OF THAT WOULD BE A REASON FOR STAYING WITHIN THEIR FRAMEWORK IN USING THAT GENERAL CLASSES BUT WE WON THAT I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT AT ALL WHICH IS SOMETHING WE SHARED A WAY LIKE FOR THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION I MEAN WHO OF US  THE BASIC HARD IMPORTANCE OF THE ANSWER THE COMBINED MEASURE MIGHT NOT BE IF WE WERE TO WAIT FOR THE EARNEST CO PANIESILY OFF I TEASTUFF TANOFIR I EAT SIR BASICALLY APART FROM THE DISPLAY MORE THAT DISPLAY ITSELF WE DON'T HAVE AN EXTREMELY HIGH DEGREE OF INTERACTION BETWEEN SORT OF OUR MODELS THAT CREATE THE STUFF AND AN TENTEFACE THE NEFAS IS MAINLY WHILE IT'S RUNNING CHEST OR OMENDATED THAT'S JUST LOADED FROM A FIRE I GUESS DATA IT TO A AASEARCH FATAL LIAISON WORK YE NOW YET THE SEARCHES A GAS THE SEARCHES OF THE STRANGE BEAST ANYWAY WE FOR THE SEARCH BE LEAVING THE NIGHT EX M FRAME WORK EM BUT THAT'S STILL SORT OF THAT'S GOOD THAT MEANS AT LEAST LIKE WON'T HAVE THAT OBSERVATION WORK SOMEBODY HAS TO DO LIKE A BILLION CALCULATIONS ON ON DATA ON LINE THAT WOULD MAKE IT A LOT MORE LIKE THAT WOULD MEAN THAT OUR INTERFERES FOR THE DATA WE HAVE TO BE A LOT MORE CAREFUL ABOUT HOW IT PERFORMS AND IN EVERY THING AND NOBODY IS MODIFYING THAT DATA AT AT ON LINE TIME AT ALL IT SEEMS NOBODY IS MAKING ANY CHANGES TO THE ACTUAL DATA ON LINE SO THAT PSYCHE MAKING IT A LOT EASIER THAT BETTER TO MISS OUR BROWSER REALLY IS A VIEWER MOSTLY WHICH ISN'T DOING MUCH WITH THE DATE EXCEPT FOUR SORT OF SELECTING A PIECE IT FIT AN AND FLAYING IT WE SELDOM GO FOR DUMPING INTO A DAY'S CE WE SELDOM DUMP IN A DAY'S PACE WHILE SOME PARTS RELEVANT FOR THE SEARCH YES I'D SAY SO CAUSE IF WE ARE I RECKON WE SHOULD ALL READ OUR CLASS OTIS SO MUCH IEASIER I WELL IF WE GO TO DUMP THEIR PARTLY IN DAT BATEAU DUMPLE TO MIND THE DATE BATEATO THERE SO WE DON'T EVEN HAVE TO WORRY THAT MUCH ABOUT THE UN THE LONG ABOLITION WE JUST QUEER BUT NOBODY OF US IS DOING MUCH OF SEARCHING FROM THE DATA IN THE ONLINE STAGE AND FOR ALL TOGETHER LIKE THE DISPLAY ITSELF I THINK WERE EASIER IF WE IF IT'S SITTING ON THE EX SMELL THAN IF IT SITTING ON THE EQUAL STUFF IT SITTING ON THE EX SMELL WE HAVE THE THE NITE SMELL FRAME WORK WITH ALL ITS FUNCTIONALTY FOR SYNCHRONIZING THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT LEVELS WHENEVER THERE'S A CHANGE EVER AN IN MOVING FORWARD STUFF AN I I AM I LOOK AT THE COAT LIKE HOW THE PLAYER MOVES FORWARD AND HOW THAT MOVING FORWARD ITS RESENT THE AN WEEL AN STUFF I THINK IN THE ACTUAL BROWSER ITSELF I DON'T WANT TO SIT ON THE CURL IF I CAN SIT ON THE MELIFSITING ON THE EX MEW HAVE ALL WE HAVE OF UCH HELP AND FOR FOR LIKE THE THE CALCULATIONS THAT WE'RE DOING APART FROM THE SEARCH IT SEEMS EVERY ONE NEEDS SOME SPECIAL REPENSATIONS ANYWAY A WEGUNDY THAT WE SHOULD TRY AND STORE EVERYTHING MAXIMO FORMA AS WELL EVEN OUR RESULTS HERE IN IN THE NIGHT EMIL SMELL FORMED SO WITH THEIR TIME STEMSUFFS THAT IT'S EASY TO TO TIE TOGETHER THINGS ARE WHAT I'M LIKE AWE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT IF WE GO WITH THIS MULTI LEVEL IDEA LIKE THIS IDEA THAT SORT OF IF YOU START WITH THE WHOLE MEETING SERIES AS ONE ENTITY IS ONE THING THAT YOU DISPLAY IS ONE WHOLE SORT OF THAT THEN THE INDIVIDUAL CHUNKS ARE THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WHEREAS AN THEN YOU CAN CLICK ON A MEETING AND THEN SORT OF THE MEETING ISPTHE WHOLE THING AND THE CHUNKS ARE THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS THAT MEANS SORT OF E HAVE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF REPRESENTATION WID WE PROBABLY IF WE IF WE DO IT THIS WAY IT WIT SIS I DO IT IS WITH AN WE SHO PROBABLY FIND SOME ABSTRACTION MODELS SO THAT THE FACE IN THE SENSE LIKE DEALS WITH IT AS IF IT'S THE SAME THAT I AS TESN'T REALLY HAS TO WORRY WHETHER IT'S A MEETING IN THE WHOLE MEETING SERIES OR A SEGMENT WITHIN A MEETINGYOU NOW WHAT I MEAN AND THAT'S PROBABLY STUFF THAT WE HAVE SO FLAKE PROCESS TWICE THEN LIKE FROM THAT LIKE THE SUMMARY OF A MEETING WITHIN THE WHOLE MEETING CORPUS OR MEETING SERIOUSLY A MEETING SERIOUSLY GOOD WORD THAT I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT HOW TO CALL IT YOU NOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE NOT NOT THE WHOLE CORPS BUT EVERY MEETING THAT HAS TO DO WITS ONE TOPIC I'M SO IN IN THE MEETING SERIOUS SO THAT A SUMMARY FOR A MEETING WITHIN THE MEETING SERIES A SORT OF COMPILED OFF LAND BY A SUMMARY MODEL AND THAT IS SEPARATE FROM A SUMMARY OF A SEGMENT WITHIN A MEETING AS I DON'T THINK WE CAN WELL WE DON'T EVEN NEED AND US WE GOT OUR NOTATION THAT THE COAT OFF LINE SO WE DO TRY THE WHOLE LOT AS ONE MASSIVE DOCUMENT IN A NOT WE SO BIG WE CAN TO DENAINFORMATION THAT THE FEVER ACRES INTO SUNRISE BASED ON THAT I THOUGHT WE WOULD JUST HAVE PLAYED ONE BIG SUMMARY M WAS ONLY A DIFFERENT IMPORTANCE LEVELS EM DISPLAYED ON IT AND DEPENDING ON WHAT OUR ZULEVIES WOULD JUST AS PLAY A PART OF IT SO ARE WE DOING THAT AT ALL LEVELS AVE EM AND WOULD HAVE ONE VERY BIG THINGS OF LIFE AND FROM THAT WE WOULD JUST SELECT AT OWES LEANEST A DIFFERENT LIKE FINE GREATNESSES LEVELS SORT OF YES SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU WOULD M GIVE HIGH VALUE TO THOSE M SEQUENCES YU WANT TOULA THE ETANG SERIES SUMMERSO THE ONLY THIS THAT CAT OF A SO THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD HAPPEN EELY IF I DOUBLE CLICK LATIFROM THE WHOLE MEETING SERIES ON A SINGLE MEETING IS THAT THE SUM LEVEL CHANGES LIKE THE THE START IN THE END POSITION CHANGES AND THE SUM LEVEL CHANGES THAT WAS WHAT I SAW I AGE ENVOY I THOUGHT WE COULDN'T DO THAT I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT WE COULDN'T O THAT WE COW COULDN'T LOAD THE DATE OF ALL THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW I MEAN THAT I THINK THERE'S VERY MUCH POINTING LIKE THAT WHEN IT'S JUST TO FEED OFF IN THE END THE INFORMATION DENTATAEY AND THAT'S ALL CALCULATE OFF LINE IS ALL YOU'RE REALLY DOING ITS SORT LIST THIS THE COMPETITION A HARD PART OF IT SO I'M SORORITIES I AAMATION OF IT IS REFRACTORY IN A EASE YOU DO I SAY IF I SET A TEA OR A WHOLE DOCTORATE ALIENATED AND THE LAY SO A ITERATION THE ELIAUTES SO TRAINED TO A A OW I WAS JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE TOTAL MEMORY COMPLEXITY IT BUT A ARIDAEUS SORT OF LIKE TO THAT FROM SOME THING THAT JONATHAN ONE SAID ABOUT NOT LOADING EVERYTHING BUT MAYBE HAVE A WRONG BUT AN WHEN YOU PIATINK THE DIFFERENCE MIGHT BE THAT WE WOULD JUST WHAT WE HAVE A THE WORDS AND THAT'S NOT SO MUCH PHAT HE MEANT WAS A POSSIBLY LOADING EVERYTHING WAS HEELED OR THE ANNOTATION STUFF OR THE SON FITS OR WE THINK WE HAVE STOUT AN INTENSE FOR WORDS THAT CLEEVERYCIN THE WORD YET BUT IT MA IT MIGHT BUT IT MIGHT SOUND CRAZY IN THE PLAY WE SHOULD REALLY MAYBE WE CAN DO THAT TOGETHER AT SOME POINT TO DAY THAT WE CHECKED OUT HOW THE PLAY WORKS I THINK BUT THERE'S MAY BE SOME MERIT AND ALTOGETHER TINGE UTTERANCE THAT AM GETTIN QUITE SAMANON US AN WHAT'S AN OUR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE M S E THE IMPORTANCE MEASURE AND THE COMING I MEAN TO BE TO BOTH US THE SAME THING WHILE THE SKIN IS KIN ENGAGED IN PORTOBELLO ON ANNE TALK BOUT SUMMARY SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS BUT ABOUT SKIMMING ABOUT ABOUT BOLESKI WHAT BUT ALSO ABOUT THE DISPLAYS I MEAN THE DISPLACED IN'T THE IN THE TEXT BODY IN THE IN THE LATEST DRAFT THAT WE HAD OF WECAMEOV WITH THE IDEA THAT IT ISN'T DISPLAYING UTTERANCE UTTERANCE IT ALSO DISPLAYING A SUMMARISED VERSION IN YOU NO LIKE BELOW THERE BELOW THE GRAPE PART YE MAY MAYBE YES IF IT ISN'T THAT THE SKI N'T ISN'T THAT TO SIM OH YES IT'S JUST LIKE THAT THIS LIKE AUDIO SKIMMING AND THIS DISPLAYED SKIMMING NEVER DO SAME DATA YE YE MAYBE THERE'S SOME MERIT OF GOING ALTOGETHER FATTERNC LEE OR POTHER TO CALCULATE I MEAN IF YOU HAVE TO DO IT INTERNALLY THAN YOU CAN DO BUT MAY BE LIKE NOT STORED THE IMPORTANCE LEVEL OR INDIVIDUAL WORDS AN JUST SORT OF RANK UTTERANCES AS A WHOLE NOISY OOLITIC IS NO MORE LIKE YES SIMIANS IT MIGHT BE BETTER SKIMMING IN LESS MEMORY REQUIRED AT THE SAME TIME AN I MEAN IF YOU IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DO IT FOR INDIVIDUAL WORDS THAN YOU CAN JUST IN THE WORDS GETTECAN'T IN IN TINGES MAMAN OF THE WORDS OF THE UTTERANCE NOW AT IM AN NOT QUINET YOU WANT TO DO JUST ANTOSIGND WHAT'S THE SMALLEST CHUNK AT THE MOMENT YOU THINK OF OF SIGNING AN IMPORTANCE MATURE WORTER TRANCE I THOUGHT ABOUT WORDS SO WE'RE THINKING OF LIKE MAYBE JUST STORING IT ON AN UTTERANCE LEVEL BECAUSE IT'S IT'S LESS STUFF TO STORE PROBABLY FOR DAVE IN THE IN THE AUDIO PLAYING ANY FOR IN THE DISPLAYED FOLLY BETTER IF YOU HOLD UTTERANCES THEN I DON'T NOLA'S LIKE YOU JUST TAKE SINGLE WORDS OUT OF UTTERANCE THAT PROBLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE OVERISHOW IMPORTANT UTTERANCE BUT THE UTTERANCE A WHOLE MATS MORE TENSE IT DOESN'T MAKE MAK A DIFFERENT OR YOUR OTANES US MEANS THAT IF YOU WORK ON A WORD LEVEL THAN EACH MEAN IT OVER I THINK WE ARE SO OUT ABOUT COMMANDING THAT MEDORO SOME TIMES I GET ME A HOT POT THEY ARE ALL THAT WORD OUT SO BEYOND A THAT'S GOOD ANY WEALS AT MAKES THE OLSEN PUT IT ON ORATORIO I I AILIE OH YES NO I MEAN LIKE HOW I JUST MEAN DOES IT IN NYON NOW BUT IT'S PROBABLY A YOU PRATE WORD ON WORD LEVELS FOR IMPORTANCE BUT THERE SHOULD BE WAYS OF EASILY GOING FROM A WORD LEVEL TO AN UTTERANCE AL RECKON ESTO ABOUT THE YOU PROFESS I I THINK I SHOULD EVER AS A RACE OVER OVER WHOLE UTTERANCE THE WORDS AND THERE ARE QUITE AN IMPORT HERE OPORTO WORDS AS WEEL I THINK WE SHOULD JUST AS I ORATE SHOULD HAVE IT CUT OFF SO WORD ONLY GET A VOLTAIRE SO ANYTHING THAT HAS A OOOORTA ONE ZERO FOR WE DO PRELLTRING A SORT OF A HOLE EAT OF LIKELY BUT THAT LIKE THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS IT EASY TO DO IN THE TEXT DEVIL BUT THAT WOULD MEAN IT WOULD STILL PLAY THE AIR IN YOUR AUDIO UNLESS WE SORT OF FALSE OR STORE WARDPIECES WE CUT OUT FOR THE AUDIO YEA I THINK BEFORE WE CAN LET ANSWER THAT SPECIFIC QUESTION HOW WE DEAL WITH IT IT'S PROBABLY GOOD FOR US TO LOOK AT WHAT THE AUDIO PLAY IS CAPABLE OF DOING I THINK OF TO OFFER AUDIT I THINK IT'LL BE VERY HARD THINK IT'LL BE AN HOUR OR TWO'S WORK SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PUFFING THE ETHIE DIRECTS FEELING AN ANOTHER I E THAT PATIENT THERE NO BUT NOT STORED ON THE HARD TESTING THE LOADED IN BUT LOADED INDIRECTLY FROM MEMORY OR SUGGEST BY AN THAT I A MENIAL WAY OR OSIER JUROR AT IS COVETOUS TOM INARI FREEN O IN IN A IEIAEA HE MUST HAVE A CASSEROLE AS ASSASSINATION I GUESS I MEAN SO THAT MEANS THAT THAT PROBABLY I IF YOU GO ON UTTERANCE LEVEL THERE'S STILL SOME MERIT ON WITHIN UTTERANCE HE'S CUTTING OUT STUFF WHICH CLEARLY IS RELEVANT AT ALL AND THAT MAY BE ALSO FOR THE AUDIT HAVE OR LET'S SAY WE PLAY THE WHOLE PHRASE BUT THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE SOME INFORMATION THAT SAYS MINUS THAT PROSAIC THAT'S THE CAR THAT WIN YOU OH I THINK A MITRAILLE AS A CLASS JUST FEELING LIST FIRM THE OH YES BECAUSE THEN WE CAN ALSO DO THE DISPLAY ABOUT WHO'S SPEAKING WE ALSO REALLY WON'T BE ON SEARCH WHY HE IS SPEAKING AS WELL HE BUT I AM STILL CONFUSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT LIKE THAT CHESS WOULD DROWN US THAT BUT THAT WE CAN'T DO LIKE LODEMASSIVE DOCUMENT OF THAT SIZE BUT DEAR ME TAIL THE CALCULATIONS DON OF LO THE OTHER END I MEAN IT SHOULDN'T BE LIKE BLKEAFTIFTY MAGABITE AND RUMANIAN I M TO LAST FIFTY HUNDRED MAGABIT IT'S QUITE DIFFER THINKING WHAT THIS IN SO WE DO GET AN ARROW MESSAGE WAS THE PROJECT IF WE LOAD EVERY THING INTO THE PROJECT WITH ALL THE DATA THEY LOAD SO WE KNOW THAT DOESN'T WORK SO OUR HOPE IS ESSENTIALLY THAT WE LOAD LESSON TO IT WHAT'S THIS LAZY LOADING THING SOMEBODY EXPLAIN LAZY LOADING TO WINSTON IS A LAETITIA FILE IT WAS IN A SO THAT IS THAT ONLY BY TYPE OF FILE IF IF IF THE SAME THING IS IN DIFFERENT FILES WOT THEN MAY BE LIKE I NOW IF IF UTTERANCES ARE SPLIT OVER THREE OR TEN OR ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT FILES IS THEN A CHANCE AT IT DOESN'T TRY TO LOAD THEM ONE MEMORY THE SAME TAMASESE TITES BUT WHAT IS IT FAIL THEN IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IT SHOULD EVER FAIL TO TEN IT SHOULD NEVER BE TO EAT OR TO A A THEMAL YES BUT AM I IT FAIL RIEN LOAD IT RIETI IS THAT IT'S THAT INTEREST  AS I DEFEND BACOLOD FOR EXAMPLE IT LOTS ALL THE UTTERANCE I ANS ONE BUT IT DOESN'T LOAM THE DOES COS E S E A LOT AS A AS A BUTT SUMMARIES NOT TO LET'S CHECK IT OUT AND I'LL I'LL PROBABLY ASK JONATHAN ABOUT IT SO ALTERNATIVELY IF WE REALIZE THAT WE CAN'T DO THE WHOLE THING IN ONE GO WE COULD PROBABLY JUST PROCESS SOME SORT OF META DATA IN A VERMILIKES OR SORT OF FOR THE WHOLE SERIES CHUNKS REPRESENTING THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS OF SOME LIKE SOMETHING THAT REPRESENTS THE WHOLE SERIES IN IN IN A STRUCTURE VERY SIMILAR TO THE STRUCTURE WHICH WE REPRESENT INDIVIDUAL M MEETINGS BUT WITH DATE A SORT OF ALWAYS COMBINED FROM THE WHOLE SERIOUS SO INSTEAD OF HAVING A SINGLE UTTERANCE THAT WE DISPLAY WOULD PROBABLY BE LIKE THAT WOULD BE REPRESENTING A WHOLE AM TOPIC A SEGMENT IN A MEETING AT SO SO THAT USING THE SAME DAY YOU MEAN THAT YOU M THESE THAT A BATHING IN TWO DIFFERENT SUMMARIES RINSES THAT YOU HAVE A VERY AM TOPPLE A SUMMARY AND A SEPARATE FIVE FOR RUCHOTHINKI IN A SENSE LIKE CREATING A VIRTUAL A VIRTUAL MEETING OUT OF THE WHOLE MEETING SERIOUS SORT OF ACT I SEE JUSTICE A NEW BODYE SORT OF LIKE OFF LINE CREATE A VIRTUAL MEETING WHICH WHICH BEATTIE TREATS THE MEETING SERIES AS IF IT WAS A MEETING AND TREAT THE INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS WITHIN THE SERIES AS IF THEY WERE SEGMENTS AND TREATS THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS WITH IN MEETINGS AS IF THEY WERE A UTTERANCES YOU NOW SO JUST SO WE SHIFTED ONE LEVEL UP AND IN THAT WAY WE COULD PROBABLY USE THE SAME ALGORITHM AND JUST LIKE MAKE VERITE ONE OR TWO IF THAT SAY K IF YOU ARE ON A WHOLE DOCUMENT A WHOLE SERIOUS LEVELED THAT WAS A DOUBLE CLICK THEN DON'T JUST GO INTO THAT A SEGMENT BUT LO THE NEW FILE OR SOMETHING LIKE IT BUT IN GENERAL USE THE SAME AGREEIN VERNIE CAN'T AYLO THE WHOLE THING AND BECAUSE I'LL SELIG EVEN IF WE MAYBE THIS WHOLE LEG MAYBE I'M WORRYING TO MUCH ABOUT THE WHOLE SERIES IN ONE THING THIS PLAY BECAUSE THEY YEAN PROBABLY USE US WOULDN'T YOU THAT ON TWO OF ANAITIS EAT AT ROME IS TO HIS TEA HAINES IS WILL THE OFF LYING STUFF AS ANY AS I AND ALL WE CAN DO IS IS OUT O THE THING I AS SOME RIATA ON A HUNDRED OR ESDAILE IN ETTIE I TO ONE PARTRIDGES AT OTHER ETAIS E S IN ONE ALREADY I SOME RESOURCELESS AND THEN IN A ROSSETTI YES BUT AM ILL WORD LET ROME FOR THE DISPLAY IF YOU ACTUALLY IF YOU WANT A DISPLAY THE LEG FOR THE WHOLE SERIES THEIR INFORMATION DENSITY LEVELS BASED ON AN END AND THE ONLY GRANULARITY YOU HAVE IS INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCES TEMANITE GO TO EVERY SINGLE AT RENTS IN A SERIES OF SEVEN HOURS A NEREID STORE MAN LATELY SEENE ME SO THEN IF YOU MAKE THAT STRUCTURE VERY SIMILAR TO THE DELLA ONE LEVEL DOWN LIKE THE WAY HAVE OR INDIVIDUAL UTTERANCES STUFF THAT A VEIN MORE THIS ENCOUNTERS A F U I SENT STUFF SO BUT STILL SO IN GENERAL WE HAVING WE HAVING UTTERANCES AND THEY HAVE A SCORE AND THAT'S AS MUCH AS WE REALLY NEED AND AND THEY ALSO HAVE A TIME TIME INFORMATION OF COURSE SPEAKER AND ELISE AND ASTER INFORMATION A TOPIC AND NEED AS WELL YES AND INFORMATION WHICH TOPIC THEY ARE IN HERE AND AND PROBABLY SEPARATE TO THAT AND INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TOPICS TASTED SO SO THE SKIMMING CAN WORK ON THAT WITH THE SKIMMING CHESTS OUT OF SORTS THE UTTERANCES AND PUT AS MANY IN AS WALENN O PRESERVE THE ORDER WHEN IT IS LATE YE YE IT IT'LL PLAY THEM IN SOME ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE SET BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT'S GOING TO BE MORE ENTERTAINING M BUT THAT THAT'S ENOUGH DATA FOR THE SKIMMING AND THAT THE SEARCHING SO HE SEARCHING THOSE SEARCHING LEAVES THE WHOLE FLAME WORK GOES TO THE ESQUILDATA BASE AND GETS LIKE BETTINE GETS JUST A TIME MARK FOR WHERE THAT IS LIKE THAT UTTERANCE THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED WITH AND THEN WE HAVE TO FIND THEM HERE THERE'S SOME WAY IN AND NADA'S MATCHES SAY THAT POSITION TO THAT TIME MARK AND THEN IT SHIFTS THE WHOLE FRAME IN THE ALERT EVERY SINGLE ELEMENT OF THE DISPLAY AND THE DISPLAY UP DAT I OROETES OR OOOHERE HERE THAT TIES SO IF IF SOME SO SO IF IN THAT TREE DISPLAY SOMEBODY LIKE ON SOME THIN EACH NETTIE FRAME STUMP HERE AND THEN YOU SORT OF THAT THAT TIME TAMETO AND THE NATICELL CENTRAL MANAGED THAT CENTRAL MANAGER ALERT EVERY THING THAT STAR LIKE ALERT TSAMPA THAT HOT DISPLAY ALERT THE TSPLARLRT THE ITALIPLAY AND THAT WE HAVE A NEW TIME PRAY AND THEN THEY ALL SORT O TO THE UP THE REINS WITH RESPECT TO THE CURRENT LEVEL OF SUMS OR HOW MUCH THEY DISPLAY THAN STARTING POSITION AT WE'RE THERE OR MAYBE THE MID POSITION OF IT I DON'T KNOW LIKE IF YOU START WITH THING WAS FOUND OR IF THAT THING TO WAS FOUND IS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PART THAT WE PLAY THAT I DON'T NOW WHAT THAT WE A DEID ABOUT IT GENERAL SORT OF IT'S THE SAME THING IF LIKE WHETHER YOU PLAY IT MOVES FORWARD OVER THE YOU JUMP OUR POSITION SEARCHED HE SELY FOR ALL THE WINDOW HANDLING IT THE SAME EVENT IT'S ONLY THAT THE EVENT GETS TRIGGERED BY THE SEARCH RATIN WITH TENEMENT AND SAYS PLEASE GO THERE NOW SO WE YOU PLAYING LIKE OR THAT ELDON MEMORY DE EVERYONE MODEL CHANGES THAT RATHER THAN THE UNDERLYING DATE AND THEN HAVE THAT EXCEL AN I ELABORATE TIED TO THE INTERLACE WHY DO WE HAVE IT IN MEMORIES THAT START YOU TO MAKE A FIRE IF YOU WANT I MEAN LIKE THE INFORMATION AS COMING FROM OFF LINES SIR WE PROBABLY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO CHANGE THE UTTERANCE DOCUMENT RICE BECAUSE THE WHOLE WAY LIKE THE WHOLE BEAUTY OF THE NATICMEL IS THAT IT TIES TOGETHER LOTS OF TIRAILLEURS RAT AN ADDITIONAL MALPAIS FOR EVERY UTTERANCE LIKE THE UTTERANCE OF IDEAS ASSUME SOME REFERENCES SO WE JUST WE TIE A JUST VERY SHORT MEPHITIS THE ONLY INFORMATION IT HAS IT HAS WHATEVER A NUMBER FOR FOR THERE AN WAIT FOR THE INFORMATION THAT THE ATOSTIE THAT TO THE EXISTING UTTERANCES AND TIE THEM TO THE EXISTING SPEAKER CHANGES BUT THERE'S NO IDEA FOR IN ETIENNE INDIVIDUAL WORD SO HOW DO WE DO LONDON KNOW IT OR FATE IS AS WELL I THINK IT'S DIS ONE WELL SO WE HAVE SEGMENT PORTER YES WELL OTHERWISE WE'D PROBABLY HAVE TO GO OVER IN LIKE ADD SOME INTEGER THAT WE JUST INCREMENT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM SORT OF EVERY OHRANTE AS AND AS AN IDEA SOMETIME OR ON OR TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW NATICA IDEAS WORK AND MAYBE THERE'S SOME SPECIAL RULE TO AS OF FOLLOW WHEN WE USE THESE IDEAS EMPEROURS ALREADY THERE PRETORIA THE THEE OUR ONES ARE NUMBERED EVEN TO THE GIRLS SAY THE UTTERANCES THEMSELVES ARE NOT NUMBERED AT THE MOMENT I AM NOT QUITE SURE I HAVE ONLY SEEN THAT THERE THE INDIVIDUAL WORDS A LADY SO I GUESS IT WOULD BE SOLVABLE IF NOT YES YOU ALWAYS COULD HAVE A LOOK AT THE TIME STEPAN AND TAKE THE ONE STEP ALONG TOGETHER TO FORM AN ENTRANCE I THINK YOU'D JUST TAKE THE SEGMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY IF THEY ARE I E THE EXIGENCIES AMNON THE EX MEN IN A SAID A PORT MARK A PENDANT I JUST LIKE TO MAKE A LIST OF ALL THE STUFF AWAY FOR YE AN SOMEBODY DO THE PAPER ONLY FANCY AND THE WOOD TO THE STUFF WE HAVE WE HAVE UTTERANCES AND SPEAKERS AND WAIT FOR UTTERANCES FOR FOR EVERY UTTERANCE THAT OF LATE THE UTTERANCE HAS A SPEAKER AND A WAITER IS COMING FROM OUTSIDE OR WHICH IS TIED TO IT AND THERE IS SEGMENTS WHICH THEY ARE AFTER A SEERESS PLAY I WAS SO SORRY YE THAT'S A TERM IS TOPIC SEGMENTS I MEANT LIKE THEY'RE THEY'RE SUPER UNITS SO SO THE UTTERANCES ARE TIED TO TOPIC SEGMENTS AND IF THE TIME STAMPS ARE ON A WORD LEVEL THEN WE SOMEHOW HAVE TO EXTRACT TIME STAMPS FOR AT RENTS WHERE THEY START THERE THERE TIME AM EM FOR THE SEGMENTS EM WHAR SEGMENTS NOW UM SEGMENTS FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DATA WARES DISPLAYED IN ONE LINE WHEN WHEN YOU IS THE SAME AS A FRANCIS IS THAT THE SAME AS UTTERANCES THAT ELISE THEY MAY NOT BE EXACT A AMFORTAS AM I I COMPETED OR WERE FOR THE PAUSE IN DURATION EXTRACTION AM AND PHYSICALLY IT'S A WORDS THAT ARE UTTERED IN A SEANCE WITHOUT PAUSES BUT SOMETIMES HOWEVER THERE ARE A SHAUAUSES AETHER INDICATED BY A WAITSPAUSAU THAT'S A BUT THAT'S ONE ONE SECOND AS THE TWO SECONDS THE I'M SOMETIMES THAT THE ANNOTATORS HEADED WHAT WAS ONCE A TENT WHAT WAS A KEY I CAST WORD BUT GENERALLY UTTERANCES IS THAT WHICH WE JUST CALLED A SORRY SEGMENT IS THAT WHICH WE JUST CALL UTTERANCES NOW I GOT A IDEA SORT OF SAGES ONE PERSON'S CONTRIBUTED A TIME SORT OF THING EDIE YES O YES WE HAVE THOSE AND THINE HAVE SOME FIELD SOMEWHERE ELSE WHICH HAS TOPICS TO YES AN TH TOPICS THESILY THEY ARE JUST AN IDEA PROBABLY WITH A START TIME OR SOMETHING AND AND THE UTTERANCE IS REVERENCE TO THOSE TOPICS HE HAS HIS THE TOPICS DON'T CONTAIN ANY REDUNDANCE THINK OF LA TING THE WHOLE TOPIC AND AT THE ASSORT OF SAY A NUMBER AND WHERE THEY START IN WHERE THEY FINISH AND THE UTTERANCES AND THEY WHICH TOPIC HE BELONG TO THE VAIN EINESOME INVITATIONS SOME ANAITIS AND SOMEONE ASAKO OEIALOEC ON SO HE AND ABE WAS THINKING OF THE TOPIC SEGMENTATION NOW IN INUEFOR THAT THERE WOULD ONLY BE ONE RETAINS OF LIKE PICTURES A TIME WINDOW SOULE SO IF THIS LAZY LOADING WORKS IN THIS SHOULD DEFINITELY FIT IN TO I MEAN NOT MEMORY THEN BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T ALL BE MEMORY AT THE SAME TIME SO IF EACH HAS HAVE TO STOP THAT INFORMATION LIKE A LONG LIST OF ALL THE UTTERANCES SLASH SEGMENTS AND LIKE SHORT OR SMALLER LISTS WHICH GIVE WEIGHT TO THEM AND EVEN THE PROBABLY IF THERE'S A LOT OF OVERHEAD IN HAVING TWO DIFFERENT FILES WE CAN PROBABLY MERGED THE WEIGHTS INTO IT OFF LINE NOW WHAT I MEAN LIKE IF IF THERE'S A LOT OF BUREAUCRACY INVOLVED WITH HAVING TWO DIFFERENT TREES AND WHETHER ONE TIES TO THE OTHER BECAUSE THE ONE HAS TO WAIT FOR THE OTHER THAN IS PROB QUICKER TO JUST A WHITE JUST RIGHT AS NEAR A MAIL CAN NIGHT HANDLE JUST RIGHT IN ARBITRARY A NEW TOSTOFF I ALTER SO I YET THOUGH THERE WAS THE WHOLE BEAUTY THAT LIKE YOU CAN JUST MAKE A NEW EXPEL FILE IN SORT OF TITHE TO THE OTHER END AND IN AVOIDING A EARED OH YES SIR NO I DIDN'T I DIDN'T MEAN TREE NO NO I MEAN US LIKE AND IN TOTO ILE IN R I WAS JUST THINKING LIKE IF IF THE OVERHEAD FOR HAVING THE SAME AMOUNT OF DATA COMING FROM FOOT FILES INSTEAD OF FROM ONE FILE IS MASSIVE THEN IT WOULD PROBE FROSTY'S JUST LIKE OFF LINE PUT THERE THE WAY I TOO INTO THE FILE THAT HAS TESTAMENT I YES IT AS THE ANSAREY BUT THAT WE CAN FIGURE OUT A RANTIPOLE THING IS OUT EITHER PASSION I PANIER PASSION AS PASTORAL YE YES YOU KNOW WE WE BE COMPLETELY USING LIKE THE HOLIERENC RUINED JUST I MEAN THE MAIN DIFFERENCE WELTEN OUR PROTEAN TEARS REAL IS THAT WE LOAD A DIFFERENT PART OF THE DATA OTHERWISE WE DINGINESAME WAY THAT THEY ARE DOING I SO E JUST WERE OF RUNNING DIFFERENT TOTOQUERIES OR EWEN IRENE I THINK WE ARE RUNNING QUERIES IS NOT JUST ABOUT EM WHAT WE LOAD IN AWE DON'T OO WELL RUNNING QUERIES IN THE SENATE DYNAMITE SELECT BY BY WEIGHT ON THEN WE HAVE TO CHECK HOW FAST THAT IS THAT TO SAY GIVE US ALL THE ONES THAT WHETHER THAT WORKS WITH THEIR QUERY LANG WEE WHETHER THAT WILL RESULT IN HATE WE YO KNOW IF IF I LET SAY A MINE IF THEIR QUARRY LANGUAGE IS STRANGE AND IF I WOULD RETURN TEN MILLION RESULTS IN I CAN'T HANDLE IT THEN WE CAN JUST WRITE OUR INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS IN THE WAY THAT THEY KNOW WHAT WHAT THE RETURN THE SO THEY STILL GET ALL THE DATA AND JUS SATURNALI SAY OR NO THIS IS LESS THAN WE ARE AT PATHETAY A SON IN I MEAN PRICE TO SEE THE INJUSTICE IN CHUNKS YE NO I WILL I'M JUST THINKING FOR THIS WHOLE THING OF LIKE A DIFFERENT LEVEL SORT OF CUTTING OUT DIFFERENT DIFFERENT PIECES WHETHER WE DO THAT SOUGH A QUARRY WHERE WE SAY GIVE US EVERYTHING THAT'S ABOVE THIS AND THIS WEIGHT OR WHETHER WE KEEP THE SAME IN FRENSTRUCTION BUT EVERY INDIVIDUAL MODEL LIKE THE PLAYER AND THE DISPLAY SAY LIKE THEY STILL GET SORT OF ALL THE DIFFERENT UTTERANCES ALL THE DIFFERENT PIECES BUT THEY SAY ALL THIS PIECE I LEAVE OUT TO PAUSE IT'S BELOW THE CURRENT THRESHOLD LETHEAN POLIDORE I'M SORRY I PULL STORE A HIERARCHICAL INFORMATION AND SIT AS WELL WITH AND IN FOMENTATION TENSITY SCORE FOR EACH MEETING AND EACH TOPIC IN AN OTHERWISE WILL BE RE CALCULATE SANE THING OVER OVER OVER AND THEREOVER TREE AND THOU OBVIOUS EATER IS WHEN DO WE NEED THE ONE FOR THE MEET A MAN NOW WHO MEIAYER I GUESS FOR THE SO WHEN WE HAVE TISPLAVOR WE DISPLAY THE WHOLE SERIES THEN IF WE HAVE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TOPIC SEGMENT WITHIN THE MEETINGS WE HAVE READY CALCULATED I AM METHANE DON'T HAVE FOR OF EXTRACT THAT THE FROM THE DIVIDUAL UTTERANCE YE THAT'S ALSO FAIRLY IS TO STORE ALONG WITH OUR SEGMENTS FOR THE SEGMENTS ARE WE EXTRACTING SOME TYPE OF TITLE FOR THEM THAT WE CRAFT IT FROM FANCY A GRET MAMANALLY OF EACH AS TAKING THE SINGLE MOST HIGHLY VALUED KEY WORD UTTERANCE FOR THE SEGMENT HEADING TO ALL WE CAN STARVE BY THAT I WAS GOING TO START A COPY THREE AND TWENTY ONE THAT DOES JUST IT AND THEN JUST CHANGE THAT TO WORK OVER IT'S PROBABLY LIKE AN END PROBABLY IT WOULDN'T BE THE BEST THING IF IT'S JUST THE HIGH MOST HIGHLY RANKED PRAISE KEY WORD GO TAKE FOR EXAMPLE FOR AN INTRODUCTION THAT WOULD MOST DEFINITELY NOT BE ANYTHING THAT HAS ANY TITLE ANY WERE SIMILAR TO INTRODUCTION SONIA O STUFF O WORSE AND THE KEY WORD OR ALSO I FOR THIS PART MAY BE IF WE GO OVER IT NADENTITY ME ENIMME Y E ONE OF IDEAL HAS SOME NAME ETI TICO TO SPARE AND HE LIKE THIS FOR THEE FOR SORT OF FOR FINDING TOPICS TITLES FOR FOR SEGMENTS JUS TAKE A NAMED ENTITY WHICH HAS A REALLY HIGH WHAT'S IT CALLED DEADER YOU'D PROBABLY BE QUITE LIKELY TO TALK ABOUT A CONFERENCE OR A PERSON THAT THAT WOULD BE NAMED ENTITY WHICH IS VERY HIGHLY FOMENTER PORTION O AMEDEE YATHODAYA HIS AT THERE QUISARSOR THAT TAINE TONE OTHER FACING TO A OECENERAL ALACIELIKE ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S PARPONAMED ENTITIES I DESCRIBE OR THE ORTASEGENT ASAPOU WOURALI BE QUITE TO LIKE IF THERE'S SOME NAME OF M CONFEREN THAT WOULD PROBABLY SATHANAME OF THE CORNARO MAY TO RIDE THE TEA IN DIRECT REFERENCE TO IT ANYWAY HE SAID HE SAID YORKICARRENT IN MEANING THAT I I IT'S NOT HERE I DERISIVELY IT'S RELEASE A IT'S JUST LOOK FOR A PLACE LIE PUT TO A JOB OF WELL A WAS WORKING A AY SEATING THE HONOR ON A PERVERT LEVEL ANYA AGAIN AND THEN AFRANIUS IT'S NOT LIKE RELATED TO THE ORATORS JUST CONON TREES ON A KICK I WAS JUST WONDERING WHERE HE HAD THE CORPSE FOR A AT T MOMENT NO SO IT IT SEEMS THAT THE DATA STRUCTURE ISN'T A BIG PROBLEM AND THAT BASIA WE DON'T HAVE OUR HAVE ALL THESE MASSIVE DISCUSSIONS OF HOW WE EXACTLY INTACT THE DATA STRUCTURE BECAUSE MOST OF OUR WORK ISN'T DONE WITH THE DATA STRUCTURE IN MEMORY IN THE BROWS BUT IT'S JUST DONE OFF LINE AND EVERY ONE CAN REPRESENTED ANYWAY THEY WANT A LONG ESTESOV STORE IT IN A TETE REND ACTION IN THE END SO IT MAY BE USEFUL TO KNOW HOW I RESTORE THAT THING SAY YET THAT WOULD MEAN UNDERSTANDING THEN I'D ALEXELZOROV FORMED IN LOMORDITO WE SHOULD I THINK WE SHOULD JUST HAVE A LONG SESSION IN THE COVED ROOM TOGETHER LIKE NOW THAT WE KNOW WE MORE WOULD WE WANT TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT MIAGO MELLOWED A FEW HOURS THE OTHER AS A FATHER TO ENTER THE ATAMAN ANCE STAND THEN HE THERE THERE'S A FURORE AND THEN I ISAACSON AND TAKE ON THE CAR THE ITALIC UTTERANCE SEGMENT TEN ISAACO AND THEY ARE NUMBERED A STEWARD YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE TUDOR ALICE AND ONE DAY SAID TO A IHAELSIE SAID AN A AS AN AMAIN AT A QUIVER WHO'S WHOSE SORT OF DOING THERE THE CENTRAL COORDINATION OF OF OF THE BROWS APPLICATION ARE LIKE A INTEGRATION TIME INTEGRATION YE BUT ALSO LIKE ALL THESE ELEMENTS LIKE LIKE THE LOADING AND A INTEGRATION AND AND LIKE HANDLING THE DATA LOADING AND STUFF DON'T WE THINK ANNE'S BEEN LIKE I DO IT I'M SORT OF LIKE I THINK I'LL TAKE OVER THERE DISPLAY JUST BECAUSE I'VE STARTED WITH A BIT AND FOUND IT HE FOUND IT DURABLE AT A SO SOMEBODY SHOULD SORT OF BE THE ONE PERSON WHO'S WHO UNDERSTANDS MOST ABOUT WHAT'S CENTRALLY GOING ON WITH WITHER WITH THE PROJECT LIKE WITHER WITHER TROUSERS OR HOLLAND WHERE THE DATA COMES IN AND SO MY PORING TASK IS ALSO COMPLICATED BY A CAT BUT DIFFICULT I WON'T MOVE I GUESS WE CAN DO IT LIKE SEVERAL PEE TOGETHER PROBABLY JUST THOSE PEOPLE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER A LOT OF VERY CLOSE INTEREST MAKE SURE THAT THEY ALWAYS UNDERSTAND WHAT TAHER ONE'S DOING I GUESS THE IMPORTANT THINGS TOGETHER RESOLUTELY STADESIMPLE LEGENDE AN ORGAN ALREADY MADE VERSIONS OF THEM FOR THAT MATTER AND HERE THE MAY BE A APACE SMITTEN YOU BUT I THINK I ELETTHE MOMENT INTEGRATION COMES FIRST TO THAT SORT OF IT THE MOMENT THE BUILDING THE BROWSE COMES FIRST AND THEN ONLY COMES THE CREATING NEW SOPHISTICATE DATA HUNS BECAUSE THAT SORT OF THE WOLF THING ABOUT HAVING A PROTOTYPE SYSTEM WHICH IS MORE LET'S WORKING ON ON TRUNK DATA BUT IT TALAVERA A WITHIN TEN EVERYTHING IN AND LOOK AT EVERYTHING AS BEFORE WE HAVE THAT IT BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR ANY ONE TO REALLY SEE HOW MUCH THE WORK AT THAT AGITATING SENSE O JUST WELL I GUESS YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING FROM THE DATA THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL AMELIUS THAT YOU CREATE IT I WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE SOME DAYS ON IT THUSIA STUFF SO MAY WE SHOULD TRY DOING SOMETHING REALLY SIMPLE LIKE JUST AS PLAYING A HOME MEETING AND LIKE JUST BEING A SCROLL THROUGH IT OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT OR JUST A DEPTH LIKE THE LE SORT OF GO FROM THEIR SYSTEM AND AN ADEPT AT PEACE FOR PEACE AND SEE HOW WE CAN HOW WE COULD ARRANGE A LAKE ADAPTED TO OUR SYSTEM DOES ANY ONE WANT YOU LIKE TO SIT WITH ME AND LIKE PLAY FOR THREE HOURS WITH ATTIC SMELL AT SOME POINT ARE YOU FREE OF THIS I WOULDN'T LIKE TO BE BUT LIKE I GOT JIM I'M THEORETICALLY FREE BUT IF THERE'S ANY TIME OF FRIDAY SOME OF A FRIDAY I HAVE NOTHING TO FOOTE ON WEDNESDAY AY A WEDNESDAY ON ON TILL TWELVE NINE TILL TWELVE IN THE NOTHING YOU HAVE VERY EARLY AFTERNOON I GOT NOTHING IN THE AFTERNOO ANY TIME WINS DAY AFTERNOON I I CAKE SO WE'RE ABOUT JUST ENOUGH IN TOWN YA FOREST TILL WHATEVER ONE SEES TO DISGUST A FEE I'LL BE IN THE AETOLIAN KAY WHAT TIME DO YO WANT YO A WELL BE THERE FROM A GOATEE ON ON THAT LAST OF YOUR OTHER BATEATO KETILL JUST MEET YOU IN EIGHTEEN IN THE AFTERNOON I GUESS AT THE MOMENT NOBODY CRITICALLY DEPENDS ON LIKE THE NITE SMELL STUFF WORKING RIGHT NOW RIGHT LIKE A MOMENT CAN ALL DO THE STUFF AND I CAN DO MY OTHERS A STUFF AND I CAN EVEN DO THE DISPLAYED TO A VAST DEGREE WITHOUT TACTICALLY HAVING THE SUPPLYING FRAMEWORK WORK IN SO IT'S NOT THAT CRUCIAUL A IOWA WETONA TO I NO OH I HAVE TO SEE IN A DIETY I NEED EROTIC SAYS WILLIAM I WAS I WAS MORE THINKING OF THE SORT OF THIRD DEL BROWS OR FRAME WORK AS A RUNNING PROGRAMME NOW YOU SEE I THINK WE ALL NEED EROTICS AND DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT FLAVOURS TO BE A EATERS YOU THE BEATITUDE ON ONLY JUST GOT TO OTTAVIANO TO A TON PITY I THINK IS QUITE EASY I OTASITE PARSEE SOME AEOLIAN TEAM IS TO SO ONSARTAIN IN ON IN THE ORDER YOU YOU I THAT WHAT AS I THOUGHT YES YES COMBINE THEM IN THE ORDER THE ENTERED YES THAT'S A POTENTIAL I WAS GOING TO AMUSE AND WHAT I FOUND OUT WAS STICKIN THAT THEY ARE QUITE A LOT OF THINGS WITHOUT WITHOUT AN TEMPS IN THE BEGINNING WHAT FAILS YES YES I OTHERS YET THAT'S JUST AN IDEA OR THING AND EVERY THERE'S WORD HAS TIME TEMPTS THEM YES BUT WHAT ARE THE OTHER THINGS THAT'S SOME KIND OF NUMBER MANY TAFIA NUMERIAN IS IN THE BEGINNING WHAT IS THAT TO THINK THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF NUMBERS IN THE BEGINNING WHERE THERE IS NO TIME STAMP OR BUMBERS  THEY SAY YE QUITE A LOT OF NUMBERS BEFORE THE ER THE IS NUMBER NUMBER WITHIN THE EX MEL CONTEXT YE ARE NUMBERS AND THE HELTER STEM ARE THEY SPOKEN NUMBER LIKE DO THEY LOOK LIKE THEIR UTTERANCES YES ETHER'S THE NUMBER TASK ISN'T THERE THAT'S PART OF THE THING BUT AT THE END MAKER AND BEGINNING AS WELL AS I I I READ LES SASELLADY IF WE HAVE TO BE COUNTED OUT ANYWAY FOR OUR PROGENY KNOW SO BY GOING TO SCREW UP A LOT OF OUR DATA OTHERWISE BE NOT SURE IF IT WERE AS I THINK IT WOULDN'T AS FIRST I MEAN IT WOULD CURSE EVERY MEETING IT WOULD PROBABLY MAKE THE TEA IF YOU SAMANTHA PRAY I THINK I EVEN ITS OWN ANNOTATION LIKE ITERATION I ER EASY AND JUST THINK THAT PROD PROD PROBABLY LIKE THE ELISE WOULD PERFORM QUITE WELL ON IT WOULD PROUDLY FIND ANOTHER NUMBER TASK QUITE EASILY EYE A CONSTRAINED VOCABULARY WITH A HIGH CO CURRENTS OF THE SAME NINE WORDS TO THE ITERATION OF A NOTION I THINK IT'S ALL SOMETHING THAT THEY THEY SET THE NUMBERS IN ORDER RIGHT THEY'VE TO READ NUMBERS YET I THINK IT IT SOUNDED LIKE THEY WANTED TO CHECK OUT HOW WELL THEY WERE DOING WITH OVERLAPPING THE STUFF BECAUSE VASILY IT'S LIKE THEY'RE READING THEM AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS BUT YOU KNOW IN WHICH ORDER THEY ARE SET AND IF I DIDN'T HAVE A LOOK AT THAT SO IXE HAD SOME REASONS FOR DOING IT AS TO INSIST SAYING LEG NUMBERS AT THE END OF THE ROOM AND ALSO A VERY DIFFERENT COM COMBINATIONS OF LETTERS THE ARYANS SOMETHING AND THAT IS EVERYTHING ORDERED ARE THE TIMES STEMS GLOBAL OR ARE THEY LOCAL AND AN A THEATER DAVE IF YOU ARE ECLAIRCISSEMENT WELL IF YOU ARE DOING I DES OR WHATEVER YOU CALL YOUR YOUR FREQUENT IS OR EUNANE YOU NEED SOME DICTIONARY FOR THAT AT SOME POINT THE LIKE O NEED THAT SOME REPRESENTATION OF A WORD AS NOT NOT THAT SPECIFIC OCCURRENCE OF THE WORD TOKEN BUT OF OF OF A GIVEN WORD FOR BECOME AN ACCOUNT THE WORD OF THE LINGA DICTION YES WE SHOULD WORK TOGETHER IN THAT RESIGNING THE DICTIONARY AS WELL I MUST JUST CAN EASY A HUSH A ONE IN A JOB AS A MONEYED ASMODEUSO OF UNTIL WE AMATOOONY YOU SIGNESIN TO OVER DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT TO ASIATICUS YES OR A FOREFATHER WHOLE THING IT IS SOME WHERE THE TWO SAT THAT THEM HERE SOME PROGRAMME THAT OUT A DIARY ROARED RAINBOW IT'S OI THINK IT'S JUST ECONOMISE IS ANY ONE OF YOU FOR THE FOR THE DOMINICAN FREE YOU CAN I HAVE TO FREQUENT FOR THEN THAT RIGHT LEG OVER THE WHOLE CARNAGE TO THE OAND SO I WILL ONLY COUNT FOR EACH IN A INITIATION IT WAS RAIN AS A ISAIAHINK IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO HAVE AS A BOON LYES A SATIATED LIKE LIKE THAT COPIES OF SHAKESPEARE'S YES SURE YOU'RE SURE WE COULD DO THAT BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT MAKES SENSE CAUSE IF AS IF WE WERE LOOKING FOR A FREQUENTATION HOW THAT CHANGE AETATICATION WE NEED JUST WHAT WINES MANICHEES ACUTE USING POLO OR THERE MAY BE ANOTHER TO A IT'S QUITE EASY TO JUST COUNT ON A ONE ONE FREQUENCY USING WHICH TO LAY IT UP IS USING A PARLE SCRIPT BE CAREFUL WITH THAT LIE MY EXPERIENCE WHA BODE NATIONAL CORPO WAS THAT THERE'S FAR MORE WORD TYPES THAN YOU EVER THINK CAUSE ANY THING THAT SORT OF UNUSUAL GENERALLY IS A NEW WORD TYPE LIKE ANY TYPE OR ANY STRANGE THING WHERE THEY PUT TWO WORDS TOGETHER AND ALSO ANY NUMBER IS A WORD TYPE OF ITS OWN SO YOU CAN EASILY END UP WI A HUNDRED THOUSANDS OF WORDS WHEN YOU DIDN'T EXPECT THEM SO SO GENERALLY DICTIONARIES CAN GROW BIGGER THAN YOU THINK THEY DO NO I DON'T I AM A PROBATION ROY RECITAL LECTURE LEPRESION IN A SANE CONSIST OF ONE DID IT TEN GIBIER IF IT CONSISTS ANY SPECIAL CHARACTERS AN GIVE ERBISOME IN A OTTEAUSY NOT ONE WHEN I HAPPENED IN I REMEMBER WHO'S GOT IT MIGHTY WORD THAT AT ONE OF THESE HE CUT OUT A LESS TO STOP WORDS E OUTRIGHT AND LET US BE EITHER UNINTERESTING BORING WORDS THAT WE CUT FILTER OUT BEFORE WE DO THAT I LIKE THAT ON THE PAPERS I READ THAT THE ONE THING THEY DID WRITE BEGINNING AS THEY'VE GOT THE THINKSTOP LIST AND THEY JUST TIGNORE ALL THESE BUT I DID FOR MY PROTEGE JUST IGNORED THEIR HUNDRED MOST FREQUENT WORDS BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY END A BOLD BEING ARTICLES THEN TIE EVERYTHING THAT'S DONE SO WE NEED TAKE SEVERAL OF US NEED A DICTIONARY AND I THE ONLY ONE WHO NEED TEAR IT IN I I BE USEFUL FOR MAY AS WELL AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NEEDS IT WITH FREQUENCY SIR I I I A USEFUL OREQUENEY WELL I GUESS AS SOON AS WE HAVE THE ROAD TACK WE CAN PROBABLY JUST START WITH A COVER HASH MAP AND LEG JUST HASH UP OVER IT AND SEE HOW FAR WE GET THEM IN CAN PROBABLY ON A MACHINE WITH A FEW HUNDRED MACABRAM YOU CAN GO QUITE FAR CAN RUN IT ON BEEF EE IF IF IT GOES WRONG IN IT IF DOESN'T NEVER A LATIN TO GAIN SOME SUSIE OUT ICE AN I HATE UN DICE CESARINE I I MACHINE OR YOU'RE BURNING IT ON A LIKE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO BURN THE HOLE I WAS JUST LECOELL YOU SEE I SEE I ASK SUPPORT ABOUT THAT TWO DAYS AGO IN THE INFORMATI BUILDING THERE AS ERIN IN APPLE TOWER FIFE THE ONE CLOSEST TWO MACHINES CLOSEST TO THE SUPPORT OF SOI PRESUME HOWEVER I HAVE THE EXACT I THINK YOU TACKLE OF THE ONES THAT ELROY AND COLEYIF YOU ENTER THE BIG ROOM IN THE RIGHT HAND CORNER I THINK AND THE THING IS LIKE YOU CAN ONLY BURN FROM THE LOCAL FILEY TOM TO IF IT'S FROM WELL ACTUALLY THINK IF IT'S MOUNTED YOU CAN DIRECTLY BURN THE UNROVE MY DATA ON BEEF AND SO I HAVE TO GET IT INTO THE LOCAL TEMPT DIRECTOR IN ON IT FROM THE BUT YOU CAN BURN FROM THERE HOW BIG IS IT WITHOUT A ARE WE LOOK AT THAT NOW I'VE WHILES WE LOOK AT IT AND I FORGOT BECAUSE I COULD JUST SAY IT I M GOING OVER A SEA EE ONE NIGHT TO SLEEP IT GOING ALL NIGHT IF I HAD TO AN WISHED BABE TO GET AT IT I DON'T THINK IT WAS I DON'T THINK IT WAS A GIG ABOUT IN THE WAVE THE OISE AGAIN SEE I WOULD OFF I WOULD OFFER YOU TO GET IT ON THIS ONE AND THEN THEY COPIED FOR YOU KNOW WHAT I FIGURED OUT I'M QUICKER DOWN LOADING OVER BROAD BANDAGE MARIA THAN USING THIS HARVEST THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THE WAY HOW THEY AXES THE HARTES HOW THEY MOUNTED WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE I'LL SEE I CAN MEYERS WHAT OPERATING SYSTEM DO YOU HAVE OF COURSE LINES ORSINI WHAT CONNECTION DO YOU HAVE AT HOME O YES SO IF ANY ONE OF US GETS IT WE CAN THEN JUST USE EXCITE I CAN GET BURNT CITY OR PUT IT ON ON HARD JUST WHATEVER QUESTION IS IF YOU'RE NOT QUICKER IF YOU CAUSE YOU SHOULD GET MASSIVE COMPRESSION OUT OF THAT LIKE FIFTY PERCENT OR SOME THING WITH A GOOD AGREE SO IF YOU COULD COMPRESS IT AND JUST PUT IN TO ATTEMPT ROSEEN OF SPACE IS THE TEMPERED THE TEMPS USUALLY HAVE TO DIG ABOUT FREE REALLY THE TEMPS HERE LIKE I MEAN THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT ANYTHING'S TASTE BUT OVERNIGHT IT'LL STAY AND I THINK THE TEMPS USUALLY HAVE AY BUT THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE THE TEMPT DIRECTORY OF THE MACHINE NESSES AGENT TO DIRECT THE OFFICE AS I I CAN DO IT FROM THAT SESSION ON INFERS FROM A REMOTE SECTION AS SANE EST YET THAT THEY PROBABLY HATE YOU FOR DOING IT BUT THEY TOLD ME THEY'D LIKE YOU MORE IF YOU SIS INTO ANOTHER COMPUTER COMPRESS IT THERE AND THEN SORT OF COPY IT INTO THEIR INTO THE GATEWAY MACHINE DO YOU THINK THEY ARE IF YESTERDAY YOU KNOW IF YOU IF YOU YESTERDAGENT THEY'VE THIS BIG WARNING ABOUT DOING NOTHING AT ALL IN THE GATE NO I THINK I SAINTSINTE SOME MACHINE THERE AND THEN JUST A SEEING IT FROM THERE TO YOUR HOME MACHINE ERE AMIASKASHI I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW TO TUNNEL THROUGH THE GATEWAY INTO ANOTHER LESLIE IT'S NOT IT'S NOT EASY DEFINITELY THAT'S WHY I END UP SORT OF COPYING STUFF IT THE TEMPT DIRECTORY AT THE GATE THE MACHINE SO AS THIS PORING EVERYBODY ELSE DID AS HOW TO GET STUFF HOME FROM WET JUST LOOK AT THAT TOGETHER WHEN WE'RE MEETING I AM A TESTA ONE SO WHO'S AN DOIN M THE FREQUENCIES ON THE WORDS BECAUSE I I THINK I WILL ALSO I COULD ALSO MAKE US OF IT FOR THE AGREEMENT DISAGREEMENT IN BECAUSE I AM I A ANITOO AM USING THEE JUST CAUSE ACTS FIRST AND AM THAN IN THEORIES I FOUND LOOKING FOR WORK AT ANANOSO AM I WOULD FOR EXAMPLE HE THE AM MOST FRET FREQUENT WORDS WE SO FEW ALL THE ONE AS SOON AS SOMEBODY GIVES ME THE ROD TEXT OF THE WHOLE THING I CAN PROBE JUST IMPLEMENTS LIKE A FIVE LANDOVER HASH TABLE FREQUENCY DICTIONARY BILL RENTS YE BUT I NEED IT FOR MY TENT I OUGHT NO O DID YOU NOT SAY FREQUENTERS IN HOLE SORT YAVI I I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THE FREE WORD IN MY I'M IN THE REGIONS OF TET I FOUND OUT TO BE INTERESTING SO I WOULDN'T NEED IT IT WOULD HAVE TO BE RE CALCULATED ART HAVE LANDED YOURSELF HERE BUT FIRST HOW BIG THE CHUNKS HOW BIG ARE THE TRUNKS TO A A I THINK IT BE NOW AS A BIGGER AS A ATUONA ARE QUITE THAT'S QUITS MY DATES JUST SOME ADDRESSES YOU IS JUST THE SAME THING WE USED TO BUILD THAT THE TEST TO THAT ONE LINE SO I OULD A LITTLE HAITIANS AME TOYES SO I WOULD PROBABLY JUST CONCATENATED ON MY IAMAIS EN THAT'S AN AEON OR OH YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE DIFFERENT COUNTS FOR A CHANCE LIKE FOUR FOR SOMETHING FROM ALL CHUNKS YES OH YE NO THAT'S YES ONCE I WRITE ON A LEG IF I WRITE LIKE AN AGRAWICH DOES A HASH AM TABLE DICTIONARY WITH FREQUENCY FROM A RAW TEXTS IN THE RATEX CAN BE ANYTHING SO HOW FAR ARE WE HOW FAR ARE YOU GETTING RATE OF FICOING AND I CAN GET ALL THE ATAXIA TO BE ODETTE SO O KA WO THAT'S GOOD BECAUSE FOR THE DICTIONARY HE ORDER DOES MEGIDDO SO YES SO AN I'LL GET THAT FROM YOU AND I'LL WRITE A HASH TABLE WHICH GOES OVER THAT INGRATE DICTIONARY FILE SO FOR THE DICTIONARY ISN'T OKI DO WHATEVER WORD BLANK FREQUENCY AS SOME THINK JUST COULD EVERYBODY THOUGHT OF START FROM THAT I MEAN I GUILE A EATIN TYDE THE OASIS IT'S IN WHAT IMPLEMENTS MAN WAS INFORMATION GAIN I'M NOT QUITE SURE HOW THEY CALCULATE THAT I USE FREQUENT YOU BE USEFUL I THINK YES I NEED PRETENCE FOR DEPENDING ON THE CONTEST THE SIZE AND WHAT WE CONSIDER A DOCUMENT IN AN ACACIA ANACANGE WHICH I THINKING ABOUT BUT I THINK WE MIGHT HAVE A LOT IN COMMON WHAT A CACTUS I FROM MY LATENT MEDIC ANALYSIS NEED LIKE COUNTS OF WORDS WITHIN THE DOCUMENT WITHIN A SECOND ACE WITHIN A TOPIC AEETES WAS AN WOOIN JUST GET FOOTFALLS OR FOLIATED CONVERT HIS PROBITY THAT TO FREQUENCIES I WILE SO THAT'S WHAT RAIN BODES HIS HAT WHAT LES A BILLS WHEN I GET ILSE DOCUMENT BY FRIENDS MATRIX SCOPERTA AMER BUT I ALREADY HAVE I ALREADY HAVE MY COAT TO BUILD IT UP MYSELF MANDATE MY COAT AY AM YESTERDAY YOU SAID YOU NEED THE FREQUENT ACCOUNTS ACTUALLY HOORAY SURE FOR A DOCUMENT BUT YOU SAY NOT FOR THE WHOLE WORLD WE NEED THE RAW FREQUENTS WELL THE YOU ALSO NEED HOW MANY TIMES THINGS OCCUR WITHIN EACH DOCUMENT AND WHAT WE CONSIDER A DOCUMENT AND DEPEND ON OUR CONTEXT I THINK AS IF WE'RE LOOKING AT THE WHOLE LOT OF MEETIINGS OR AN INERT MEAN DOCUMENTS IN MATERIAL GOOD IN INITIATE IN EATS SMALL OCIANYOU MIGHT LOOK ENACOCUMANTS AS A SMALL DOCUMENT IT MORE AND MORE APPEARS TO ME THAT IF WE IF WE SCRAPE THE NOTION OF THE MEETING AS AN INDIVIDUAL THING A SORT OF SEE MEETINGS AS A TOPIC SEGMENTS AND I'VE THOUGHT OF LIKE HIERARCHIC TOPIC SEGMENTATION INSTEAD THEN I LIKE A NOTE HERE IN FRAMEWORK THE NATION THOUGHT OF HOW AN MAYBE IT DOESN'T MATTER MATTER MAY BE IF YOU JUST DO IT ONCE AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IT'LL BE FINE BUT JUST THINK IT MIGHT BE DIFFICULT CONTAINED OF LINE FOR A FAN LEVELS E MIGHT WANT IF WIGAN ALLOW DISJOINT SAID EXAMPLE HOW WE DIDN'T KNOW OO IN CONTACT ANY TIE I SUPPOSE IF YOU JUST DID IT GLOBE TREATING AND MEETING AS A DOTATION ET IRE WORK OUT FINE BECAUSE YOU'D ONLY BE COMPARING IT EOETHEN ARE WE USING THIS M FOR THERE FOR THEY'RE FOR THE DOCK FOR THE WAITING IN THE END NOW THIS THIS MEASURE YOU'RE CALCULATING I DO NO THOUGHT WE CAN EASE AT THE END AS THE INFORMATION THAT I BECAUSE IF WE DRINK A THING FOR FOR THE INFORMATION DENSITY WE WE SHOULD CALCULATE IT ON THE LOWEST LEVEL ON THE HIGHEST POIETES A MAN LIKE YER WORD OR CROSS THE WHOLE LOT I MEAN BY HIGHEST CROSS THE WHOLE COAST BUT I DON'T YET TO LET GO SORT OF LIKE FOR IN A DOCUMENT WERE IS THE WHOLE THING ISN'T THAT HOW IT WORKS THAT YOU LIKE EVERY POLITICO I DON'T THINK IT A COLD A FEASISN'T IT LETHABEK THAT TO CHANGE OVER IT BE DIFFERENT TOPIC SEGMENT MORE THAT THEY TALK ABOUT SOMETHING DIFFERENT IN EACH DIFEOPIC SEGMENT POSSIBLY THAT'S WHAT RELATIVE TERM FREQUENCIES ABOUT THEIR LAY IN SOME CONTEXT THEIR TALKING MORE ABOUT A CERTAIN WORD THAN GENERAL THERE WOULD MORE BE THERE THE TOPIC SEGMENT THAN AND THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT AS WELL THAT YOU THAT PROBABLY THE TOPIC SEGMENT LEVEL IS THE MOST PROBABLE THE MEN ARE THEY BIG ENOUGH TO GET THE PROBLEM AT NO SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE'S WAYS TO ABANDON THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF OF MEETINGS IN SORT OF BUT JUST NOT REALLY TREATING SEPARATE MEETINGS AS TOO MUCH OF A SEPARATE ENTERS NO NOT ETIENNETTE AND AT A OATH WE STILL WANT TO HAVE LIKE A NOTION OF MEETINGS FOR THE USE YES BUT ON A RHYTHMIC LEVEL WHETHER WE WHETHER THERE'S SOME WAY TO JUST REPRESENT MEETINGS AS THE TOP JUST WHY YOU WANT TO LOOK AT YOU JAMMED TOGETHER IN TRENOFILE AND THAT'S YOUR MEETING ME A BIT O ME COME FRIVOLITY I DON'T SEE WHY THAT REALLY BE POATHAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT I MEANT THAT I THINK I TUTHINK MORE ABOUT WHAT I MEANT REFUSE TO PUT IT SO BASELY SANTIN TAKEN ARBITRARY ARE DATA RIATA ALBEIT DOESN'T MATTER CONCEPT WHAT DATES IOUA MEETING UD BE TO OUIMEMEETING PLUS HALF A MEAN FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE AND I'M NOT SO AND I'M NOT SO CONCERNED ABOUT THEM A MEETING SO ON TING AS IN WAR TO A LIKE YET KEEPING KEEPING THE SAME AGREEIN THE SAME WAY OF HANDLING IT JUST SAYING LIKE JUST THIS THIS TOPIC HERE HAPPENS TO BE LIKE A WHOLE MEETING IN IT AS OF SOME TOPIC AS THAT SO TOPIC IS A HIERARCHICAL CONCEPT LIE A TOPIC BUT THERE CAN BE SUPER TOPICS TOPICS IN THE SUPER TOPICS ARE IN THE END WALTEMEETINGS OR IN GENERAL AT SOME LEVEL SUPER TOPICS ARE TREATED LIKE LIKE TOPICS AN THINK IT EASILY MELEESE JUBILANT AMATI AND IF YOU WANT IT DOWN THE GALE AND THEN IF YOU WANT NEXT LEVEL A JIPARENT SO I AM LIKE JUST AEOLIAN WATERING ELSINIKEA A WINE ON A AEOLIKE WI IMPORT  TO BE SURE AS LONG AS LIKE THE OGRE DESIGNED THEM WITH THAT IN MIND AND IN A SO THAT I CRAIGENDARLIKE SAY YOU HAD THE IT SAFE FROM MEETING IT YOU'VE GOT LIKE A A A HIERARCHY THAT THAT WAS QUITE THIS AND LIKE THE UTTERANCES COME OFF HERE MAY BE  AND WHEN WHATEVER YOUR ALGITHA'S DIRTY AS LONG AS WHEN YOU'RE WORKIN AT UTTERANCES YOU GO FOR ALL THE LEAVES LIKE THEN IF YOU NEED SOMETHING THAT UP SO LIKE A TOPIC TO HEAR BUT IF YOU ARE LOOKING IT SAY THIS ON IKE YOU WON'T LIKE THIS I SEE I SAY YOU'D START THE LEAVES AND YOU GO ARE ON A TOPIC I I I GO AN THEY'RE UP SEE ANAN THEN IF YOU'RE WORKING IT JUST THE TOPICS I TEN THERE I SEE ANYTHING YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT AND LIKE EACH TINE YOU WANT TO HIRE LEVEL JARBERYE THE SONG'S YOU'RE ARGUIN RESPECTS THAT THEN WE CAN JUST PROCESS ANY ARBITRARY IT NOW I EVER AROSE SO THAT WOULD BE THE CURIOUS AS A WHOLE THAT WOULD PISO OF MATTEO MEET MAMMA MAMMA BID BRAIN DAMIETTA ON BEATING OTHERS TO TOGETHER WITH YOU AGAIN AND AND OVER IT AGAIN I THINK AS LONG AS YOU BUILD AN ALCOVE AND I RESPECT WHATEVER STRUCTURE IS IN THE FILE WRATHER THAN IMPOSING ITS OWN STRUCTURE SO SO ALL IS IS LIKE IS THIS AND THIS STRUCTURALLY THEN ALWAYS IDENTICAL WELL NOT SO THAT I CAN BE THAT WE CAN TREAT IT WITH A SIMAGRIT OR I MEAN IT IS MANAS YE WANT WI THIS OBADA BUT MAY BE SAY SO THEN YOU START WITH ALL YOUR UTTERANCES HERE AND WHEN YOU GO OUT TO GET TOPICS EVEN YOU GO TO H H H H THAT MIGHT BE A BIT CONFUSING THO YOU HAVE THINGS ON DIFFERENT LEVELS I AM ALSO NOT SURE HOW WE CAN GO FROM FROM BOTTOM UP OUT OVER SO TO SAY MORE THAN A WHAT CAN'T THINK OF IT A MOMENT PROBABLY THIS IS ALL TOO COMPLICATED WORRYING ABOUT THAT THAT I SEE ANYTHING ELSE TO DISCUSS NOW HAVE HAVE WE HAVE WE DECIDED ANYTHING ON ANY THE TOSS WEDNESDAY WHEN DID WE MEETIN IN AT THERE AT THEIR IMPLEMENTATION IN SOME MORE ETOITAND STAND WHATSTGOING ON TO SEE A MAN RASSELAS THE THINGS I TOGETHER YET TWO THINGS FROM THEIR STUFF JEOMAKE SURE THAT WE ARE LIKE SOME STANDARD WE AND STANDARD ENOUGH TO TO MODIFY IT IS IN RATIO ETIOLOR CORDA MAYBE HE'S WELL LAY SEE ABOUT EM HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT BY JUST MAKING LAGGED READ RIGHT FOR EVERY ONE K WHO IS MOST FREE SPACE ON THERE SAID HE I FOR GOT RID MANICURE EVERYTHING ON MY SEAT A TROIS A WE ALTERNATIVELY WE CAN PROBABLY JUST MAKE ANOTHER DIRECTORY ON THE BEEFY SCRATCH SPACE AN THAT'S RHYME HAVING GIGABOT GIT STUFF AT THE MOMENT IS THAT GUARANTEE TO STAY NO NO AND WE CAN NOT SUCCEED THEN WE CAN GET SPACE MAY WE SHOULD SEND A SUPPORT FOR BUT I THINK IF I SENT A O SOME WORKING IF HE SENT SUPPORT HE'D PROBABLY BE LISTEN BUTE I'M SURE HAD A DEAL VITAE HERE CAUSE THAT'D BE PRETTY USEFUL AS IF WE HAD A BIG DIRECTORY SAILOR TRANSFERRING AS NO HAVING SAID THAT WE ALLOW A ACTIONS ASKED I THINK HE SAID YES THAT I THINK THAT WAS LIKE IT WHEN WE WAS STILL IN THE SEMINAR ROOM I ASKED AT ONCE OR LIKE ASKED IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET IT OFF AND NOBODY SAID IT PEOPLE ARE DISCUSSING BUT DETECTING THE PRACTICALITIES BUT NOBODY SAID ANYTHING ABOUT OUR BEING ALLOWED HER NOT ALLOWED I MEAN WE HAVE ACCESS TO IT HERE AND I GUESS IT PROBABLY MEANS THAT WE WE CAN'T GIVE IT TO ANYBODY ELSE BUT IF THEY GIVE US ACCESS TO IT HERE OR SITTING ON A DICE MACHINE THEN THAT SHE TERESITA IT ON A LETTER I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE TOO MANY FRIENDS TO TEA GETTING IN ANY III HATED REALLY DECIDED PIRATE COPIED THE ETAIEANITAT ED MEETA SHALL WE EAGER A MOMENT YES I I AM WHAT I AM HE OUTRAGING I LIE I HIM NOW WHAT WOULD BE BEST AT THE MOMENT IT SEES JUSTINE I THINK THAT I BE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT HE DID FOR MY M EM I EXPECT TO IMITATE WOU ABET TO TINGE TO A CAT TO GET YOU I AM FOR EACH MEETING I THAT AS FROM AN THIS MILITATES MILTON TO WAS AS TERENCE OF WORDS AND SO ON AND SO THAT'S JUST CHANGING TO AN END OF OLD AND IF YOU LIKE SO SO YOU DO YOU EXTRACT THE WORDS THE MORE I AM YES SO FAR I EXTRACTED EM THE DR DURATION BUT IT'S FROM THE WORDS I SO I JUS T M PRINCE CUT CONCATENATED EM THE WORDS INSTEAD OF THE DURATIONS AND IT UD I MEAN SHOULD BE VERY SAID FORD I CAN TRY TO DO IT AND AT A CANTATA I WELL IT MAKES IT SO MUCH ON  HAVE WE ALREADY EXTRACTED FROM ALL THE FILES NOW I MEAN I JUST LET IT RUN OVER THE FIRST YOU ALSO ORDER YES WORD WORD WARD EDITOR YES SIR I WAS ACCORDING TO THE STATISTICS WHAT I JUST REALIZE WE SHOULD REALLY KEEDIFFRIEND SERIES COMPLETELY SEPARATE FOR VIRTUALLY ALL PURPOSES LET'S BE CAREFUL ABOUT THAT BECAUSE BUT THE LIKE THAT THE SICOPOSISN'T ISN'T ONE MEETING SERIES SEVERAL MEETINGS SERIES ITS DIFFERENT PEOPLE MEETING FOR LET DIFFERENTINGS YE AND I HAVE ONE WADI GIVE YOU WOULD BE ONE I FOR I AT FOR EACH MEETING IN YE ARE NOT FOR YOU TEOSGAWA LIKE IT LET'S JUST BE CAREFUL THAT WHAT EVER WE ORTO BE URGED TOGETHER THAT LEG AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF MARCHING IT'S NOT THE WHOLE TI CORPUS BUT INDIVIDUAL SERIOUS ON ONE BY FONTESOME WHO SO COSIEI THIN WE MIGHT EXTERIOR IT'S ROBBIE SOMEWHERE LIKE WELL OR SOMETHING LIKE AN I THINK WE MIGHT JUST GET AWAY WITH FOR THE WHOLE PROJECT JUST LIKE LOOKING AT ONLY ONE SERIOUS AND JESTING WITHIN ONE SERIOUS I MEAN YOU CAN DO EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN ONE S I MEAN THAT'S ONE SERIOUS LETHE'S ONE MEETING A YEASTY IS THE DATE ALWAYS CLEARLY SPLIT UP A DIFFERENT SERIES I LIKE IT EASY TO GET IN THAT THE DATES OF THE FORMER TIME THREE I ABATE SO B D OR B B D O O A THAT'S ALWAYS THE SAME GROUP THEN AFTER THAT THERE'S UMANUMBER LIKE A ONE OR TWO SUSO AT AT EVERY LEVEL EVERY ONE HAS TO BE CAREFUL TO RELY JEST TAKE EVEN IF AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL THE TAKE STUFF FROM ONE SERIES NOT MUCH STURMFERENT SERIOUS TOGETHER THESE WOULD ROBUSTLY MESSES STARE SO SO SO LIKE EVEN IF YOU MAKE ONE SATETAKE A WHICH HAS THE WHOLE CORPS OF OUR CORPS THAT WOULD STILL BE FROM ONE SERIES ONLY BUT BUT YOU ARE PRODUCING IT THE MOMENT HE LAY

ANYWAY I GIVE IT FOR NOW IF YOU OWEEITOSI MOINEAYOU GOIN PUT THAT AS AN OUTPUT OF YOURS IN TEKOA SO FOR NOW CAN YOU CREATE A OR OF THEIR DUMB WITH YOU YOU TAKE ECOUTE LIKIN DICTIONARY YOU IN WORK ON THAT FOR YOU TO IANTATION AND AND YOU WOULD WANT THAT ALL IN ONE FILE FOR ALL THE COPPERS OR FOR FOR THE SERIOUS BUT I CALL THE SERIES I CAN ALSO DEAL WITH SEPARATE FILES IN MAINE RITES THE OUTBREAK THAT IT OTSILFILES IN THE RETRORSOME THING BUT I MEAN THERE I CAN DIRECTLY PUT IT SO IF YOU CAN PUT IT IN ONE SINGLE MAGAFILE THAT WOULD BE QUITE USEFUL FOR ME SO ONLY WORDS AM PER MEETING SERIES EVEN FOR YOU WOULDN'T IT BE AS IF YOU HAD DIFFERENT FIGHTS BECAUSE ANY SORT OF NO LACK IF FOR ME IT'S VERY FINE SO GIVE ME GIVE ME DIFFERENT FILES AS LONG AS I IF YOU COULD NAME THEM IN A WAY THAT IS EASY TO ENUMERATE OVER THEM LIKE WHATEVER ONE TWO THREE FOR FIVE OR SOMETHING TAT'SJUST ANYTHING THAT I CAN YES THEY WILL SO WELL ESTATE OVER THE NAMES SAVENAYE IS IS THERE SOMETHING THEY EASILY ELATED TO ENUMERATE OVER A ITEMSOME ORDERED PATTERN TO ONE SERIES IS SAME TRISTE TUSSOCK YES SO ONLY WORDS AND WORDS AS NO I DON'T NEED THE TIME SUGGEST NEED THE WORDS BUT I AND THE RIGHT OR YE YOU WANT A ONE O K I HEAR ANY MAN HERE WITH LIT ORDERS I'M HARD BEST AT TIMES AND DON'T YES SOMETIMES THEY'RE CONTAINED IN ONE ANOTHER SO ANTEDATE MUTES AFTER  WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL HAVE A LEG OF PRIMITIVE SEGMENTATION BY SOME READY MADE TOPIC CITATION BY SOME READY MADE TOOL READY I MEAN TO ELEANOR CASEINE HOW KAK AS I NEED THAT TEN MEN IN A OAKHAM I THINK EM FOR ALL THE CORPS IS JUST FOR WHAT I KNOW FOR MY ATTEMPTS AT EM NINE MAGAMIE BITE TO HAVE MEANS THAT PETER SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO LICORICE WORDS WORDS HE MAGRATH OTHER WORDS TOGETHER EMPEROR OTHER MEETINGS THAT SOUNDS QUITE REASONABLE THAT'S NINE NINE CHARACTERS GUESSING OVER NOW AM WHAT I BECAUSE NINE MEGABATES IS WHAT I GOT FOR WHEN I SAID FOR ERE I'M UTTERANCE THIS A GOES FROM THAT TO THE N LET US SAY OR ARE WE ARE WE THINKING ONE PARTICULAR SERIOUS AT THE MOMENT OR I'M DOING IT FOR IT IS MATE HERE I GUESS WE CAN REFROCES THE DATA FOR DIFFERENT SERIES AND THEN CHECK WHICH SERIOUS IS THE BEST FOR THE PRESENTATION IT SOUNDS QUITE REASONABLY AND MAKE ABOUT ME IF YOU THINK IF IT'S ROUGHLY A MILLION WORDS AND NINE CHARACTER IVY WORDS I HAD LITTLE WILL BE THE SAME FOR THE WORD IS JUST WHAT I NOW YES I'M GOING TO BUILD A DICTIONARY THEN FROM THAT LIKE JUST A LIST OF THE WORDS THAT MAY BE A LIST OF THE WORDS WITH THE FREQUENCIES OR A LIST OF THE WORDS SORTED ALPHABETICALLY OR NUMERICALLY BUT WHAT DOES ANY ONE WANT TO SIT ANY WISHES FOR DICTIONARIES I COULD SEE AT A TORRENT I THINK UNTIL THE INFORMATION DENSITY INSTEAD BE REDS  SO I'LL CREATE A DICTIONARY SO AM I PROPERLY SENT EM JUST ONE FILE OF PERMEATING I'M TO ALL THOSE WHO NEED IT SO THAT IT CAN EVER LOOKED AT THE STRANGER AND THEN THE ACTUAL FILE BECAME PROBABLY COPY FROM YOUR HOME DIRECTLY OR SOMTHNLI IT I MEAN IT'S JUST FOR ONE TENIENTE BUT IM SIR I'M SAYING FOR THE WHOLE THING IN THE END I LINTIEING POLE SHOULDN'T DO BY YEA  HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE TO MAKE A ANAITEUOR FROM THE TIME I GET THE FILE CAN DO THAT IN AN OFTEN THE NEXT OR THE NEXT MORNING OH YOU MEAN HOW LONG PROCESSING TIME IT TAKES ON HOW LONG YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE IT IS BOX AND IRATE IV FIVE SORT OF I'VE WRITTEN IT FOR FOR DILL JUS IN HALF AN HOUR OR SOMETHING SIMILAR JEST HE PUT THEM IN A HASH TABLE AND AND SAY WELL IF IT EXISTS ALREADY IN THE HASH TABLE THEY NEED GREASE THE COUNT BY ONE AND I'VE PROBABLY IMPLEMENT SOME FALTER FOR FILTERING OUT N U OR SO SOMETHING BECAUSE IT'S QUITE EASY IN PARLOUS LINE OF COAT FOR COUNTING ALL THE WORDS AND REALLY I MUST BE BY ASHES MARK YOU WERE I DON'T KNOW ANY POLEMAN IF ANY ONE WANTS TO DO A POSTSCRIPT FOR THAT HE DOES IT NICELY I I'VE NO PROBLEM FOR THAT BUT I THINK I HAVE THE JOB COAT VIRTUALLY READY BECAUSE PADILLA WROTE SOMETHING VERY SIMILAR LIKE PADILLA WROTE SOMETHING THAT COUNTS THERE THE DIFFERENT OCCURRENCES OF ALL THE TAXES HAVE YOU DOING IT IN JAVA DO YOU AND CRIED ALAS IS WRITING IT TO FILE SIR IF YOU DINGAN JAVA SERIALIZED AT THE ASHTABLE AS WELL AS WRITING IT TO FILE ER NEVER SERIALIZED THEM REALLY EASY WOULDN'T THAT BE ABSOLUTELY MASTER SIR DON'T SEE WHAT'D BE ANY MORE ASIANFILE AND THEN CYRILLA AND THEN WRITE THE CYRILIZATION TO A ILE E SO YOU WANT LIKE A LIKE A FILE WHICH IS THE CYRILIZATION OF A HATESYAA T PART FINE REPRESENTATION OF IT IN NO I'LL BE EATING IT IN JAVA ANYWAY SHALL JUST BE BUILDING DATE STRUCTURE AGAIN I'LL I'LL CHECK IF I UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS I MEAN OTHERWISE I CAN GIVE YOU THE COAT FOR LOADING A DICTIONARY A IT'S JUST IT'S IT'S IT'S A LINE BREAK SEPARATED FINALLY OVER SEEMS LIKE A BIT SILLY TO BY PASSING OVER AND OVER AGAIN A YE YEA I SEE IF I UNDERSTAND HOW TO SERIAL ISE THERE'S THERE'S A SERIAL AS COMMANDER THAT GIVES ME ONE MAGAMOTHER OF THE SORT ER I THINK ALL THE COLLECTIONS AND THINGS IN PEVENSEY BLALREADY HERE BUT DO THEY AUTOMATICALLY WRITE TO THE FILE ANYWAY I'LL FIGURE THAT OUT TAKE POINT OF VIEW YES THAT'S PRETTY MUCH PRETTY MUCH IT SO DAVE AND ME LOOK AT HOW NIGHT A SMELL WORKS AND WE'RE ALL TRYING TO OESEWORK TO MORROW TO TIDE TO IT OR TO OLD I THINK I'LL BUILD A DICTIONARY AS SOON AS I GET THE TEXT AND YES THAT WHEN DO WE HAVE TO MEET AGAIN THEN HIS SUPPOSE THAT ONE OR ANON OR HOW ARE WE GOING TO DO A DEMONSTRATINEXT WEEK WE HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE SOME WHAT DO I DENONO' NOT DEMONSTRABLY DIDN'T YOU SAY THAT BUT DIDN'T WE SORT OF AGREE THAT IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE A DEMONSTRATOR OF LIKE SOME PRIMITIVE THING WORKING LIKE I SUGGESTED THE AISLE PROTOTYPE HAS GOT TO BE VERY PROTOTYPE OF A AIMERI I GAIN MORE IN  NOW LET'S GO  I FEEL LIKE LIKE HANGING IN MID AIR AND NOT REALLY LIKE FINDING A POINT WHERE YOU CAN GET YOUR TEETH INTO IT AND START WORKING FOR THE AIR AND IT'S ALL SO FUZZY THOUGH INK IS COS WE HAD TO SPECIFY IT OURSELVES THAT IT'S NO LIKIE SPECIFICATION OF VICE ON YOU BUT AT THE MOMENT BUT AT THE MOMENT IT AS AN IMP IMITATION A LEVEL I WITH THE DATA STRUCTURES IN US LIKE OVER THESE VAGUE IDEAS OF SOME TREASON ONCE WE START DOING IT WILL BECOME MORE SOLACE IT'S JUST OUR HALF WAY THROUGH THE PROJECT TIME TO VELIT

      "[\"Good morning, every one. let us get started with our patent programming session. To day we will be discussing about patent programming. We will looking. We will be looking looking at the introduction. so we need to understand that heightened programming East, open sauce, Right, and it is a generalized programming language and it is used for a Gengeneric purpose and Rick papers, and also Piton programming is scalable and it is inter active as well, and there are also other other capabilities. When it comes to Piton. it is we call it at a high level programming language. as we generally. we'll call it as highly will programming language. And it is so his independent meaning. Now it is portable. it can be used in different operating system. It supports different operating systems, and and there are different ones of benefits when we talk about fighting programming physically, it is. it acts like a medium. It, it acts like a medium of communication. What you communicate. your computer understands what you try to what you try to communicate, and process the data. Oke. When we talk about Piton, we should also know about the history of Piton. Can we should also know about the history of Piton, and also we need to understand how Piton was originated, Right who originated Piton and or how pits originator. There is the sky. A gentleman, Sid, fine rose, A, he's Dutch. This gentleman Rassam started developing Piton way back in Nineteen eighty Nine and I, Peyton was officially released or introduced in Auron Nineteen ninety one, one February, look here, and Peyton was made open sauced in and around the same year. If I'm not wrong, it was. It was open sauced in and around Nineteen ninety one itself. I, So we need to understand. We spoke about fighting being open souls. Right, so we need to understand. What what do we mean by open schools? What do we mean by open souls? We know that it is for free. Right, it is available for free that we understand, and when when we say free and open souls, it is not only the feature. it is not only about Piton being or available for free. There are other other other aspects also to being open souls. Let me let me talk about or let me now. give an example where I would like to put you in a hypothetical situation. Oke. let us say you have created a soft war. Make a person a created a soft ware, and you want to develop the soft ware. You know, initially, when you started off with the soft ware with the application, it is just an idea, right. it is just an idea. You have a soft air. You. you want you want to devil up that soft soft war further right And then at this stage, I would say is the beginning of it and you have a long way to go right. So when you're developing a soft fair, you have two options. One is commercializing it, or make it an open source, open source that is available for all the uses when it comes to commercializing this of fair. What you do is you introduce it to the market and you sell it. You have a particular clients, a bunch of clients who will make money, who will invest, and they've developed, and you, also that there's also money involved in it. Ultimately you'll get rich right, but also there is another option, bridges, or benzol, which is available enough for free handed, a bunch of fur or ment of people developing your soft lips.\", \"Does any one want to see yer Steve feed back from the specification? Is there much more in it than his? Was there much more in it than you said yesterday. Not really. was talking about duplication of effort like duplication of effort and stuff. And yes, I know she may be a. think about having a proto tater, weak sex, which is nae. So I roeper. Oh yes, I say, if for the prototype fatalite, wherever possible, chant the stuff that we have a pre aneta to stuff, and for the stuff that we don't pre anette right, like tube place line, then we should probably be able to reside that we be focus on on the inter, face first to us, so that we we take the the ready made parts and just see how we get the word to get in Antipas the way we want. Then we have a work in prototype Nd. Then we can go back and replace pieces either by our own components or by more sophisticate con comonents of our own. It probably felt things em away this week. And so if we just want to have em some Tate for the use face, could I be random later? Oh, ye ye know bout, I might like the the similarity sintimiust M matrices itself for my stuff. I. I. I think I can do that, Faye, because I have the well, go back first to a look at Niecksmell, to see in how far that that which we want is compatible with that with night a smell offers us, and then just sort of every one makes sure every one understands the interface. So I think if to day we decide on what data we want to have, now and later may be even to day. we go and look at night, Exeter, some of us to a night expedition, Tatoes, trying to make some ten socotand, See how does the pentation work? The end and then soothe knowledge. We total to an say at that to night come data. we want a load into it, and this is how every one an access it, and then E useable o, o hoo, o, o, o, o o l. I look. look the documentation and I seen enough to make me think that we want to use the night emarine work, because they have got the mole that increase the sort, the data, and in every display Havana takes a lot of work away from us. Sort of that would be a reason for staying within their framework in using that general classes. but we won that. I haven't looked at it at all, which is something we shared a way like for this whole discussion, I mean, who of us the basic hard importance of the answer. The combined measure might not be if we were to wait for the earnest co, paniesily, off I teastuff, tanofir, I eat, sir, Basically, apart from the display, more that display itself, we don't have an extremely high degree of interaction between sort of our models that create the stuff and an tenteface. The Nefas is mainly while it's running chest or omendated. that's just loaded from a fire. I guess, data it to a Aasearch, fatal liaison, work Ye now yet the searches a gas, the searches of the strange beast anyway, we for the search be leaving the night ex m frame work, em, but that's still sort of. that's good. That means at least like won't have that observation work. Somebody has to do like a billion calculations on on data on line. That would make it a lot more like that would mean that our interferes for the data. We have to be a lot more careful about how it performs and in every thing, and nobody is modifying that data at at on line time at all. It seems nobody is making any changes to the actual data on line, so that psyche, making it a lot easier that better to miss our browser really is a viewer. mostly which isn't doing much with the date except four, sort of selecting a piece it fit an, and flaying it. We seldom go for dumping into a day's Ce. we seldom dump in a day's pace, while some parts relevant for the search. Yes, I'd say so, cause if we are, I reckon we should all read our class Otis so much ieasier. I, Well, if we go to dump their partly in dat bateau dumple, to mind the date bateato there, so we don't even have to worry that much about the un, The long abolition, we just queer, but nobody of us is doing much of searching from the data in the online stage and for all together like the display itself, I think were easier if we, if it's sitting on the Ex smell than if it sitting on the equal stuff. it sitting on the Ex smell. We have the the nite smell frame work with all its functionalty for synchronizing through all the different levels whenever there's a change ever an in moving forward stuff, An I, I am. I look at the coat, like how the player moves forward and how that moving forward its resent the an weel, an stuff. I think in the actual browser itself, I don't want to sit on the curl if I can sit on the melifsiting on the ex mew. Have all we have of Uch help and for for like the the calculations that we're doing apart from the search, it seems every one needs some special repensations anyway, A wegundy that we should try and store everything maximo forma as well even our results here in in the night, Emil smell formed, so with their time stemsuffs that it's easy to to tie together. Things are what I'm like. Awe, have to think about it. if we go with this multi level idea like this idea. That, sort of, if you start with the whole meeting series as one entity is one thing that you display is one whole. Sort of that, then the individual chunks are the individual meetings, Whereas An, then you can click on a meeting and then sort of the meeting. ispthe whole thing, and the chunks are the individual segments. That means sort of E have multiple levels of representation Wid we. probably, if we, if we do it this way it wit sis, I do it is with an we. Sho, probably find some abstraction models so that the face in the sense like deals with it as if it's the same that I, as tesn't really has to worry whether it's a meeting in the whole meeting series or a segment within a meetingyou. Now what I mean and that's probably stuff that we have so flake process twice. Then like from that like the summary of a meeting within the whole meeting corpus, or meeting. Seriously, a meeting. Seriously, good word that I don't really know what how to call it you. Now what I mean like not not the whole corps, but every meeting that has to do wits one topic. I'm so in in the meeting serious, so that a summary for a meeting within the meeting series, a sort of compiled off land by a summary model, and that is separate from a summary of a segment within a meeting. as I don't think we can. Well, we don't even need. and us, we got our notation that the coat off line. So we do try the whole lot as one massive document in a Not we so big we can to denainformation that the fever acres into sunrise. Based on that, I thought we would just have played one big summary. M was only a different importance levels em displayed on it. and depending on what our zulevies would just as play a part of it, so are we doing that at all levels ave, em, and would have one very big things of life, and from that we would just select at owes leanest a different, like fine greatnesses levels. Sort of yes, so for example, you would M give high value to those M sequences. Yu want toula the Etang series Summerso, The only this that cat of a, So the only thing that would happen eely if I double click latifrom, the whole meeting series on a single meeting is that the sum level changes like the the start in the end position changes and the sum level changes. That was what I saw. I age envoy. I thought we couldn't do that. I was under the impression that we couldn't O that we cow couldn't load the date of all that, but I don't know. I mean that. I think there's very much pointing like that when it's just to feed off in the end the information dentataey and that's all calculate off line is all you're really doing its sort. List This the competition a hard part of it, so I'm sororities. I, aamation of it is refractory in a ease. you do? I say. if I set a tea or a whole doctorate, alienated and the lay. So a iteration. the Eliautes so trained to a A Ow. I was just worried about the total memory complexity. It, but a aridaeus sort of like to that from some thing that Jonathan one said about not loading everything, but maybe have a wrong. but an when you piatink. The difference might be that we would just what we have A the words. and that's not so much phat He meant was a possibly loading everything was heeled or the annotation stuff or the son fits. Or we think we have stout an intense for words that cleeverycin the word yet, but it ma, it might, but it might sound crazy in the play. We should. really. maybe we can do that together at some point to day that we checked out how the play works, I think, but there's may be some merit and altogether tinge utterance that am gettin quite samanon us. an. what's an, our difference between the m s e, the importance measure and the coming. I mean to be to both us the same thing, while the skin is kin engaged in Portobello on Anne, talk bout summary Should talk about this, but about skimming about about Boleski. What, but also about the displays. I mean the displaced, in't the in the text body in the in the latest draft that we had of Wecameov, with the idea that it isn't displaying utterance utterance, it also displaying a summarised version in you. No like below there below the grape part Ye may, maybe yes, if it isn't that the ski n't isn't that to Sim? Oh yes, it's just like that, this like audio skimming, and this displayed skimming never do same data ye ye. maybe there's some merit of going altogether fatternc, Lee or pother to calculate. I mean, if you have to do it internally than you can do, but may be like not stored the importance level or individual words. An just sort of rank utterances as a whole, noisy oolitic is no more like Yes, simians. it might be better skimming in less memory required at the same time. An. I mean, if you, if you know how to do it for individual words than you can, just in the words, gettecan't, in in tinges maman of the words of the utterance, Now at Im an not quinet. You want to do just antosignd. What's the smallest chunk at the moment You think of of signing an importance, Mature worter trance. I thought about words. so we're thinking of like, maybe just storing it on an utterance level because it's it's less stuff to store. Probably for Dave, in the in the audio, Playing any for in the displayed folly. Better if you hold utterances, then I don't. Nola's like you just take single words out of utterance That probly doesn't make any sense, overishow important utterance, but the utterance a whole mats more tense. It doesn't make Mak a different, or your otanes us means that if you work on a word level than each mean it over. I think we are so out about commanding that medoro. Some times I get me a hot pot. They are all that word out so beyond a. That's good. Any weals at Makes the olsen put it on oratorio, I, I ailie. Oh yes, no, I mean like how I just mean, does it in Nyon now, but it's probably a you prate word on word levels for importance, but there should be ways of easily going from a word level to an utterance, Al reckon esto about the you profess, I, I think I should, ever as a race over over whole utterance the words and there are quite an import here, oporto words as weel. I think we should, just as I orate should have it cut off so word only get a Voltaire. So anything that has a oooorta, one zero for we do prelltring, a sort of a hole. Eat of likely, but that, like the problem with that, is it easy to do in the text Devil, but that would mean it would still play the air in your audio unless we sort of false or store wardpieces, we cut out for the audio. Yea. I think before we can let answer that specific question how we deal with it, it's probably good for us to look at what the audio play is capable of doing. I think of to offer audit. I think it'll be very hard. Think it'll be an hour or two's work. So what do you mean by puffing the ethie directs, feeling an another. I e that patient There, No, but not stored on the hard. testing, the loaded in, but loaded indirectly from memory, or suggest by An that I, a menial way or osier juror at is covetous Tom, Inari, freen O, in in a Ieiaea, he must have a casserole as assassination. I guess I mean so that means that that, probably I. if you go on utterance level, there's still some merit on within utterance. he's cutting out stuff which clearly is relevant at all, and that may be also for the audit. Have, or let's say we play the whole phrase. But then in addition to that we have some information that says Minus that prosaic. That's the car that win you. Oh, I think a mitraille as a class just feeling list firm. the, oh yes, because then we can also do the display about who's speaking. We also really won't be on search. Why he is speaking as well he, but I am still confused because I thought like that chess would drown us that, but that we can't do like lodemassive document of that size. but dear me, tail, the calculations don of lo the other end, I mean it shouldn't be like Blkeaftifty, magabite, and Rumanian, I m to last fifty hundred magabit. It's quite differ thinking what this in? So we do get an arrow message Was the project. If we load every thing into the project with all the data they load, so we know that doesn't work. So our hope is essentially that we load lesson to it. What's this lazy loading thing? Somebody explain lazy loading to Winston is a Laetitia file. It was in a. So that is that only by type of file. If if if the same thing is in different files, wot then may be like I. Now. If if utterances are split over three or ten or one hundred different files is, then a chance at it doesn't try to load them one memory, the same tamasese tites, But what is it? Fail then in the first place and it should ever fail to ten. It should never be to eat or to a A themal. Yes, but am I it fail rien. load it. Rieti. is that it's that interest as I defend Bacolod, For example, it lots all the utterance I ans one. but it doesn't loam the does cos e s e a lot as a as a butt summaries. Not to let's check it out, and I'll I'll probably ask Jonathan about it. so alternatively, if we realize that we can't do the whole thing in one go, we could probably just process some sort of meta data in a vermilikes, or sort of for the whole series chunks, representing the individual meetings of some, like something that represents the whole series in in in a structure very similar to the structure which we represent individual M meetings, but with date, a sort of always combined from the whole serious. so instead of having a single utterance that we display would probably be like that would be representing a whole am topic, a segment in a meeting at. So so that using the same day you mean that you m these that a bathing in two different summaries rinses that you have a very Am topple, a summary and a separate five for ruchothinki. In a sense like creating a virtual, a virtual meeting out of the whole meeting serious sort of act, I see justice, a new bodye, sort of like off line, create a virtual meeting, which, which Beattie treats the meeting series as if it was a meeting and treat the individual meetings within the series as if they were segments, and treats the individual segments with in meetings as if they were a utterances. You now, so just so we shifted one level up, and in that way we could probably use the same algorithm, and just like make verite one or two. If that say K, If you are on a whole document, a whole serious leveled. that was a double click, then don't just go into that a segment, but lo the new file or something like it, but in general use the same agreein, Vernie can't aylo the whole thing. And because I'll selig, even if we maybe this whole leg, maybe I'm worrying to much about the whole series. In one thing, this play because they yean probably use us. Wouldn't you? that on two of anaitis, eat at Rome is to his tea. Haines is will the off lying stuff as any as I, and all we can do is is out o the thing I, as some riata on a hundred or esdaile in ettie, I, to one partridges at other etais e s in one already I, some resourceless and then in a Rossetti, Yes, but am ill word. let Rome for the display, If you, actually, if you want a display, the leg for the whole series. their information density levels based on an end, and the only granularity you have is individual utterances, Temanite go to every single at rents in a series of seven hours. a Nereid store man lately seene me so then if you make that structure very similar to the Della, one level down, like the way, have or individual utterances stuff that a vein more. this encounters a f. u. I sent stuff so, but still so in general we having we having utterances, and they have a score, and that's as much as we really need. And and they also have a time time information, of course, speaker and Elise, and aster information, a topic and need as well, Yes, and information. which topic they are in here, and and probably separate to that and information about the different topics tasted so so the skimming can work on that with the skimming chests out of sorts, the utterances and put as many in as walenn. O, preserve the order when it is late, ye, ye it. it'll play them in some order in which they were set, because otherwise it's going to be more entertaining. M. But that that's enough data for the skimming, and that the searching, so he, searching those searching leaves the whole flame. Work goes to the Esquildata base, and gets like, Bettine gets just a time mark for where that is, like that utterance that you're concerned with and then we have to find them here. There's some way in, and Nada's matches, say that position to that time mark, and then it shifts the whole frame in the alert, every single element of the display and the display up dat i oroetes, or Ooohere here that ties. So if if some so so, if in that tree display somebody like on some thin, each nettie frame stump here and then you sort of that that time Tameto and the Naticell Central managed that Central manager alert every thing that star like alert tsampa that hot display, alert the Tsplarlrt, the italiplay, and that we have a new time, Pray, and then they all sort O to the up the reins with respect to the current level of sums, or how much they display than starting position at. We're there, or maybe the mid position of it. I don't know. Like if you start with thing was found, or if that thing to was found is in the middle of the part that we play that I don't now. what that we a deid about it. general, sort of, it's the same thing. If like whether you play, it moves forward over the you jump. our position. searched, He sely for all the window, handling it the same event. It's only that the event gets triggered by the search ratin with tenement and says, please go there now. So we you playing like or that Eldon memory De everyone model changes that rather than the underlying date, and then have that excel. An I elaborate, tied to the interlace, Why do we have it in memories that start you to make a fire. If you want. I mean, like the information as coming from off lines, sir, We probably don't even have to change the utterance document rice, because the whole way, like the whole beauty of the naticmel, is that it ties together lots of tirailleurs rat, an additional malpais for every utterance, like the utterance of ideas, assume some references, so we just we tie a just very short mephitis, the only information it has. it has whatever a number for. for there an wait for the information that the atostie that to the existing utterances and tie them to the existing speaker changes. But there's no idea for in Etienne, individual word, so how do we do London, know it or fate is as well, I think it's dis one. Well, so we have segment porter. Yes, Well, otherwise we'd probably have to go over in like add some integer that we just increment from top to bottom, sort of every ohrante, as and as an idea, sometime or on, or try to understand how Natica ideas work. And maybe there's some special rule to as of follow when we use these ideas Emperours, already there, pretoria, the thee. Our ones are numbered, even to the girls, say, the utterances themselves are not numbered at the moment. I am not quite sure. I have only seen that there the individual words, a lady, so I guess it would be solvable. if not. Yes, you always could have a look at the time, Stepan, and take the one step along together to form an entrance. I think you'd just take the segments that are already if they are. I e, the exigencies, Amnon, the ex men in a said a port mark a pendant. I just like to make a list of all the stuff away for ye, an somebody, do the paper only fancy, and the wood to the stuff we have. we have utterances and speakers and wait for utterances, for for every utterance that of late the utterance has a speaker and a waiter is coming from outside or which is tied to it, And there is segments which they are after a seeress play. I was so sorry ye. that's a term is topic segments. I meant like they're they're super units. So so the utterances are tied to topic segments. And if the time stamps are on a word level, then we somehow have to extract time stamps for at rents where they start there. there time am em for the segments, em whar segments now um segments, For example, when when you look at the data wares displayed in one line, when when you is the same as a Francis, Is that the same as utterances that Elise? they may not be exact. A amfortas. am I, I competed or were for the pause in duration, extraction, Am, and physically, it's a words that are uttered in a seance without pauses, But sometimes, however, there are a shauauses, aether indicated by a waitspausau. That's a. but that's one. one second as the two seconds. The I'm sometimes that the annotators headed what was once a tent. What was a key? I cast word, But generally utterances is that which we just called a sorry segment, is that which we just call utterances. Now I got a idea, sort of sages. One person's contributed a time sort of thing, Edie, yes, o, yes, we have those and thine have some field somewhere else which has topics to Yes, an th topics. Thesily, they are just an idea, probably with a start time or something. And and the utterance is reverence to those topics. He has his. The topics don't contain any redundance. Think of la ting the whole topic, and at the assort of say a number, and where they start in where they finish, and the utterances, and they which topic he belong to the vain, Einesome invitations, some anaitis, and someone Asako oeialoec, On. So he and Abe was thinking of the topic segmentation Now in inuefor, that there would only be one retains of like pictures, a time window soule. So if this lazy loading works in, this should definitely fit in to. I mean not memory, then, because it wouldn't all be memory at the same time. So if each has have to stop that information, like a long list of all the utterances, slash segments, and like short or smaller lists which give weight to them, and even the. probably, if there's a lot of overhead in having two different files, we can probably merged the weights into it off line. Now what I mean like if if there's a lot of bureaucracy involved with having two different trees and whether one ties to the other because the one has to wait for the other than is prob quicker to just a white, just right as near a mail can night handle just right. In arbitrary, a new tostoff, I alter. So I yet, though there was the whole beauty that like you can just make a new expel file, in sort of tithe to the other end and in avoiding a eared, Oh yes, sir, no, I didn't. I didn't mean tree. No, No, I mean us like, and in toto ile in r, I was just thinking like if if the overhead for having the same amount of data coming from foot files instead of from one file is massive, then it would probe Frosty's, just like Off line, Put there the way I, too, into the file that has testament. I, Yes, it as the ansarey, but that we can figure out a rantipole thing is out either passion, I panier, passion as pastoral. Ye, yes, you know we we be completely using like the Holierenc ruined. Just, I mean, the main difference welten our protean tears real, is that we load a different part of the data. Otherwise we dinginesame way that they are doing. I, so e, just were of running different totoqueries, or ewen, Irene, I think we are running queries is not just about em. what we load In awe. Don't oo well running queries in the Senate, Dynamite, select by by weight on. then we have to check how fast that is that To say, give us all the ones that. whether that works with their query lang wee, whether that will result in hate, We yo know. if if I let say a mine, if their quarry language is strange, and if I would return ten million results in, I can't handle it, then we can just write our individual components in the way that they know what. what the return? the? So they still get all the data and jus Saturnali, say or no, this is less than we are at pathetay, a son in. I mean price, to see the injustice in chunks. ye. no, I will. I'm just thinking for this whole thing of like a different level, sort of cutting out different different pieces. Whether we do that sough a quarry, where we say, give us everything that's above this and this weight, or whether we keep the same in frenstruction, but every individual model like the player and the display say like they still get sort of all the different utterances all the different pieces, but they say all this piece I leave out to pause. It's below the current threshold, Lethean Polidore, I'm sorry, I pull store a hierarchical information and sit as well with and in fomentation tensity score for each meeting and each topic in an otherwise will be re. calculate sane thing over over over and thereover tree. and thou obvious eater is, when do we need the one for the meet? A man. Now who meiayer? I guess For the so, when we have tisplavor, we display the whole series. Then if we have for the individual topic segment within the meetings, we have ready calculated, I am Methane, don't have for of extract that the from the dividual utterance Ye, that's also fairly, is to store along with our segments for the segments. Are we extracting some type of title for them that we craft it from fancy a gret mamanally of each as taking the single most highly valued key word utterance for the segment Heading to all we can starve By that. I was going to start a copy three and twenty one. That does just it, and then just change that to work over. It's probably like an end. Probably it wouldn't be the best thing if it's just the high most highly ranked praise key word. Go take for example, for an introduction that would most definitely not be anything that has any title. Any were similar to introduction, Sonia, o stuff, o, worse, and the key word, or also I, for this part may be if we go over it. Nadentity, me enimme y e. One of ideal has some name Eti Tico to spare, and he like this for thee, for sort of for finding topics. Titles for for segments jus take a named entity which has a really high. What's it called deader? You'd probably be quite likely to talk about a conference or a person that that would be named entity, which is very highly fomenter portion O Amedee Yathodaya, his at there, quisarsor, that taine tone, other facing to a oeceneral alacielike, especially if there's parponamed entities I describe, or the ortasegent asapou wourali, be quite to like if there's some name of M conferen, that would probably sathaname of the Cornaro, May to ride the tea in direct reference to it anyway, he said, he said, Yorkicarrent, in meaning that I, I, it's not here. I derisively. it's release A. It's just look for a place. Lie put to a job of well, A was working a Ay, seating the honor on a pervert level, Anya again and then Afranius. It's not like related to the orators, just conon trees on a kick. I was just wondering where he had the corpse for a at t moment. No, So it it seems that the data structure isn't a big problem, and that Basia, we don't have our, have all these massive discussions of how we exactly intact the data structure because most of our work isn't done with the data structure in memory in the brows, but it's just done off line and every one can represented anyway. They want a long. Estesov, store it in a tete rend action in the end, so it may be useful to know how I restore that thing. Say yet that would mean understanding. Then I'd Alexelzorov formed in Lomordito. We should. I think we should just have a long session in the coved room together. like now that we know we more, would we want? Take a closer look at Miago, mellowed a few hours, the other as a father to enter the Ataman Ance stand, Then he there, there's a furore and then I, Isaacson, and take on the car. the Italic utterance segment ten, Isaaco, and they are numbered A steward. You haven't looked at the Tudor Alice, and one day said to a Ihaelsie, said An A as an amain at a quiver. Who's whose sort of doing there? The central coordination of of of the brows application are like a integration time integration ye, but also like all these elements, like, like the loading and a integration, and and like handling the data loading and stuff, don't we think Anne's been like I do it. I'm sort of like. I think I'll take over there display just because I've started with a bit and found it. He found it durable at a, so somebody should sort of be the one person who's who understands most about what's centrally going on with wither with the project like wither, wither, trousers, or Holland, where the data comes in. And so my poring task is also complicated by a cat, but difficult. I won't move. I guess we can do it like several pee together. Probably just those people have to work together. a lot of very close interest. Make sure that they always understand what taher one's doing. I guess the important things together resolutely Stadesimple legende, an organ already made versions of them for that matter, and here the may be a apace smitten you, but I think I eletthe moment integration comes first to that sort of it. The moment the building the browse comes first, and then only comes the creating new sophisticate data Huns. Because that sort of the wolf thing about having a prototype system, which is more, let's working on on trunk data. but it Talavera A, within ten, everything in and look at everything as before we have that it be very difficult for any one to really see how much the work at that agitating sense. O, just well, I guess you can see something from the data that you have in your individual Amelius, that you create it. I would be nice to have some days on it Thusia stuff. So may we should try doing something really simple, like just as playing a home meeting, and like just being a scroll through it or something like that, or just a depth like the Le, sort of go from their system and an adept at peace for peace, and see how we can how we could arrange a lake adapted to our system. Does any one want you like to sit with me and like play for three hours with attic smell. At some point, Are you free of this? I wouldn't like to be, But like I got Jim, I'm theoretically free. but if there's any time of Friday, some of a Friday, I have nothing to foote on Wednesday, Ay a Wednesday on on till twelve, nine till twelve In the nothing you have very early afternoon. I got nothing in the afternoo Any time wins day afternoon. I. I cake. So we're about just enough in town, ya forest till whatever one sees to disgust a fee. I'll be in the Aetolian, Kay. what time do yo want Yo a well, be there from a goatee on on that last of your other bateato ketill, Just meet you in eighteen in the afternoon. I guess at the moment nobody critically depends on like the nite smell stuff working right now, right like a moment can all do the stuff and I can do my others a stuff, and I can even do the displayed to a vast degree without tactically having the supplying framework work in. So it's not that cruciaul a Iowa, Wetona, To I, No, Oh, I have to see in a diety, I need erotic, says William I was. I was more thinking of the sort of third del brows or frame work as a running programme. Now you see, I think we all need erotics and different in different flavours to be a eaters. You. the beatitude on only just got to Ottaviano, to a ton. Pity, I think is quite easy. I otasite parsee, some aeolian team is to so onsartain in on in the order, you you? I that. what? as I thought. Yes, Yes, combine them in the order the entered. Yes, that's a potential I was going to amuse. and what I found out was stickin that they are quite a lot of things without without an temps in the beginning. What fails? Yes, Yes, I, others yet that's just an idea or thing, and every there's word has time tempts them. Yes, but what are the other things? That's some kind of number? Many Tafia Numerian is in the beginning. What is that? to think? There are quite a lot of numbers in the beginning where there is no time stamp or bumbers. they say ye, quite a lot of numbers before the Er. The is number number. Within the Ex Mel context, ye are numbers and the helter stem. Are they spoken number like, Do they look like their utterances? Yes, Ether's the number task, isn't there? That's part of the thing, but at the end, maker and beginning as well as I. I. I read Les Sasellady, If we have to be counted out anyway, for our progeny, know so, by going to screw up a lot of our data. Otherwise be not sure if it were as, I think it wouldn't as first. I mean, it would curse every meeting. It would probably make the tea. if you, Samantha, pray, I think I, even its own annotation like iteration. I er, easy. and just think that prod prod, probably like the Elise would perform quite well on. It would proudly find another number task quite easily. eye a constrained vocabulary with a high co currents of the same nine words to the iteration of a notion. I think it's all something that they. They set the numbers in order right. They've to read numbers yet. I think it. it sounded like they wanted to check out how well they were doing with overlapping the stuff, because Vasily, it's like they're reading them at different speeds. but you know in which order they are set. And if I didn't have a look at that, so Ixe had some reasons for doing it as to insist saying leg numbers at the end of the room and also a very different com combinations of letters, The Aryans, something, and that is everything ordered. Are the times stems global, or are they local and an a theater, Dave, If you are eclaircissement, Well, if you are doing, I des, or whatever you call your, your frequent is or eunane. You need some dictionary for that. At some point the like o need that some representation of a word as not not that specific occurrence of the word token, but of of of a given word for become an account, the word of the linga diction. Yes, we should work together in that, resigning the dictionary as well. I must just can easy a hush, a one in a job as a moneyed asmodeuso of until we amatooony, you signesin to over.

It was rain as a Isaiahink. It is not possible to have as a boon lyes a satiated, like like that, copies of Shakespeare's Yes, sure, you're sure we could do that, but I don't know if that makes sense, Cause, if as if we were looking for a frequentation, How that change aetatication? We need just what wines manichees acute using Polo or there may be another to A. It's quite easy to just count on a one one frequency Using which to lay it up is using a parle script. Be careful with that lie. My experience. Wha Bode national corpo was that there's far more word types than you ever think. Cause any thing that sort of unusual generally is a new word type, like any type, or any strange thing where they put two words together, and also any number is a word type of its own, so you can easily end up wi a hundred thousands of words when you didn't expect them, So so generally dictionaries can grow bigger than you think they do. No, I don't. I am a probation Roy recital lecture. Lepresion in a sane consist of one, Did it ten gibier. If it consists any special characters, An give erbisome in a otteausy, not one. When I happened in, I remember who's got it mighty word that at one of these he cut out a less to stop words E outright, and let us be either uninteresting, boring words that we cut filter out before we do that. I like that on the papers. I read that the one thing they did write beginning as they've got the thinkstop list and they just tignore all these, but I did for my protege, just ignored their hundred most frequent words because they actually end a bold being articles, then tie everything that's done. so we need take. several of us need a dictionary, and I the only one who need tear it in. I, I be useful for May as well, am I the only one who needs it with frequency, sir, I, I, I, a useful orequeney. Well, I guess as soon as we have the road tack, we can probably just start with a cover, hash, map and leg, just hash up over it and see how far we get them in, Can probably on a machine with a few hundred macabram. You can go quite far. Can run it on beef, Ee.

How big is it Without a? Are we look at that? now? I've whiles we look at it and I forgot, because I could just say it. I m going over a sea Ee one night to sleep it going all night. If I had to an wished babe to get at it, I don't think it was. I don't think it was a gig about in the wave the Oise again. See, I would off. I would offer you to get it on this one and then they copied. For you know what I figured out, I'm quicker down loading over broad bandage Maria than using this harvest. There's something strange about the way how they axes the hartes, how they mounted, which is unfortunate. I'll see I can Meyers. What operating system do you have? Of course, lines Orsini, What connection do you have at home? O. Yes, So if any one of us gets it, we can then just use excite. I can get burnt city or put it on on hard. Just whatever question is, if you're not quicker, if you cause, you should get massive compression out of that like fifty percent or some thing with a good. Agree So if you could compress it and just put in to attempt Roseen of space is the tempered. The temps usually have to dig about free. Really the temps here like I mean, there's no guarantee that anything's taste, but overnight it'll stay and I think the temps usually have Ay. but that would have to be the tempt directory of the machine Nesses agent to direct the office, as I, I can do it from that session on infers from a remote section as sane Est. Yet that they probably hate you for doing it, but they told me they'd like you more if you sis into another computer. compress it there and then sort of copy it into their into the gateway machine.

I think it be now as a bigger as a Atuona are quite. that's quits. my dates. Just some addresses You is just the same thing we used to build that the test to that one line. So I ould a little Haitians, ame toyes, So I would probably just concatenated on my iamais En. that's an aeon or Oh, you don't want to have different counts for a chance, Like four for something from all chunks. Yes, oh ye. no. that's yes. Once I write on a leg. If I write like an Agrawich, does a hash am table dictionary with frequency from a raw texts in the ratex can be anything. So how far are we? How far are you getting rate of ficoing and I can get all the ataxia to be odette, So O ka wo. that's good, because for the dictionary he order does Megiddo. So yes, so an I'll get that from you and I'll write a hash table which goes over that ingrate dictionary file. So for the dictionary isn't Oki, do whatever word blank frequency, as some think, just could everybody thought of start from that. I mean, I guile a eatin Tyde the oasis. It's in what implements Man was information gain. I'm not quite sure how they calculate that I use frequent. You be useful. I think Yes, I need pretence for depending on the contest, the size and what we consider a document in an acacia anacange, which I thinking about, but I think we might have a lot in common. What a cactus I, from my latent medic analysis need like counts of words within the document within a second. Ace within a topic. Aeetes was an wooin. Just get footfalls or foliated, Convert his probity, that to frequencies I wile, So that's what rain bodes his hat. What les a bills When I get Ilse document by friends, matrix scoperta, Amer, but I already have. I already have my coat to build it up myself. mandate my coat. Ay am yesterday you said you need the frequent accounts. Actually, hooray, sure for a document, but you say not for the whole world. we need the raw. frequents. Well, the you also need how many times things occur within each document and what we consider a document and depend on our context. I think as if we're looking at the whole lot of meetiings or an inert mean documents in material good in initiate in eats small. Ocianyou, might look enacocumants as a small document. It more and more appears to me that if we, if we scrape the notion of the meeting as an individual thing, a sort of see meetings as a topic segments. and I've thought of like hierarchic topic segmentation instead, then I like a note here in framework, the nation thought of how An. maybe it doesn't matter. Matter may be, if you just do it once at the highest level, it'll be fine, but just think it might be difficult. contained of line for a fan levels E might want. If Wigan allow disjoint. Said example, how we didn't know Oo in contact any tie. I suppose if you just did it globe, treating and meeting as a dotation, et ire work out fine because you'd only be comparing it. Eoethen. are we using this M for there, for they're for the dock for the waiting in the end. Now this this measure you're calculating? I do no thought we can ease at the end as the information that I, because if we drink a thing for for the information density, we we should calculate it on the lowest level on the highest poietes. A man like yer word, or cross the whole lot. I mean by highest, cross the whole coast, but I don't yet to let go, sort of like for in a document were is the whole thing? Isn't that how it works that you like every politico? I don't think it a cold, a feasisn't. it lethabek that to change over it be different topic segment more that they talk about something different in each difeopic segment. Possibly, that's what relative term frequencies about their lay. In some context, their talking more about a certain word than general. There would more be there the topic segment than. And that's what I thought as well that you. that probably the topic segment level is the most probable. The men. are they big enough to get the problem at? No, So I'm just wondering if there's ways to abandon the whole concept of of meetings in sort of, but just not really treating separate meetings as too much of a separate enters. No, not etiennette, and at a oath we still want to have like a notion of meetings for the use. Yes, but on a rhythmic level, whether we, whether there's some way to just represent meetings as the top, Just why you want to look at you jammed together in Trenofile, And that's your meeting me a bit o me come frivolity. I don't see why that really be poathat's. not really what I meant that I think I tuthink more about what I meant. Refuse to put it so basely santin, taken arbitrary are data riata. Albeit doesn't matter concept, What dates Ioua meeting ud be to ouimemeeting, plus half a mean from somewhere else, And I'm not so, and I'm not so concerned about them. A meeting so on ting, as in war to a like yet, keeping keeping the same agreein the same way of handling it, just saying like just this, This topic here happens to be like a whole meeting in it as of some topic as that. So topic is a hierarchical concept, Lie a topic, but there can be super topics. Topics in the super topics are in the end waltemeetings, or in general, At some level super topics are treated like like topics. An think it easily, meleese, jubilant amati, And if you want it down the gale, and then if you want next level a jiparent. So I am like just aeolian watering Elsinikea, a wine on a aeolike wi import, To be sure, as long as like the ogre designed them with that in mind, and in a so that I craigendarlike say you had the it safe from meeting it. You've got like a a a hierarchy That that was quite this, and like the utterances come off here may be. and when whatever your algitha's dirty, As long as when you're workin at utterances, you go for all the leaves. Like then, if you need something that up, so like a topic to hear. But if you are looking it, say this on Ike. you won't like this. I see. I say you'd start the leaves, and you go are on a topic. I. I. I go. An they're up. See anan. Then if you're working it, just the topics. I ten there, I see anything you have to worry about, And like each tine you want to hire Level Jarberye. The song's you're arguin. Respects that, then we can just process any arbitrary. It Now I ever arose, So that would be the curious as a whole that would Piso of Matteo, meet mamma, Mamma, bid, brain Damietta, on beating others to together with you again and and over it again, I think as long as you build an alcove, and I respect whatever structure is in the file, wrather than imposing its own structure, So so all is is like is this, and this structurally, then always identical. Well, not so that I can be that we can treat it with a simagrit, or I mean it is manas ye want wi this obada, but may be say so. Then you start with all your utterances here, and when you go out to get topics, even you go to h. h. h. H. That might be a bit confusing, Tho you have things on different levels. I am also not sure how we can go from from bottom up out over. so to say, more than a. What can't think of it a moment? Probably this is all too complicated worrying about that that I see anything else to discuss Now have have we have we decided anything on any the toss Wednesday, When did we meetin in at there at their implementation In some more etoitand stand whatstgoing on to see a man, Rasselas. the things I together, yet two things from their stuff. Jeomake, Sure that we are like some standard we, and standard enough to to modify it is in ratio etiolor corda, Maybe he's well lay. see about em. How would you do that by just making lagged read right for every one K, who is most free space on there, said he. I for got rid manicure everything on my seat a trois. A we. Alternatively, we can probably just make another directory on the beefy scratch space. An that's rhyme. having gigabot git stuff at the moment. Is that guarantee to stay? No, No, and we can not succeed. Then we can get space. May we should send a support for. but I think if I sent a O. some working. If he sent support, he'd probably be listen. Bute I'm sure had a deal vitae here, cause that'd be pretty useful as if we had a big directory sailor transferring. As no, having said that we allow a actions asked. I think he said yes that. I think that was like it when we was still in the seminar room. I asked at once or like asked. Is it possible to get it off and nobody said it. People are discussing, but detecting the practicalities, but nobody said anything about our being allowed her not allowed. I mean we have access to it here, and I guess it probably means that we. we can't give it to anybody else. But if they give us access to it here or sitting on a dice machine, then that she Teresita. It on a letter. I personally don't have too many friends to tea. getting in any. Iii. Hated, Really decided pirate copied the etaieanitat ed meeta, Shall we eager a moment? Yes, I, I am what I am. he outraging. I lie I him. now, what would be best at the moment it sees Justine? I think that I be very similar to what he did for my M. Em. I expect to imitate wou abet, to tinge to a cat to get you. I am for each meeting I that as from an, this militates Milton, to was as terence of words, and so on. And so that's just changing to an end of old. And if you like so, so you do you extract the words? The more I am. Yes, so far I extracted em the Dr. duration, but it's from the words I, so I jus t m. Prince Cut concatenated em the words instead of the durations, And it ud, I mean should be very, said Ford, I can try to do it and at a cantata I, Well, it makes it so much on. Have we already extracted from all the files Now? I mean, I just let it run over the first. You also order Yes, word word, ward editor, Yes, sir, I was, according to the statistics, What I just realize, we should really keediffriend series completely separate for virtually all purposes. Let's be careful about that because, but the like that the sicoposisn't isn't one meeting series, several meetings series, Its different people meeting for let differentings Ye and I have one wadi. Give you would be one I for I at for each meeting in Ye are not for you, Teosgawa like it. Let's just be careful that what ever we orto be urged together that leg at the highest level of marching. It's not the whole Ti corpus, but individual serious on one by fontesome, who so cosiei thin. we might exterior. It's Robbie somewhere like well or something like An. I think we might just get away with for the whole project. Just like looking at only one serious and jesting within one serious. I mean, you can do everything you want in one. S. I mean that's one serious. Lethe's one meeting. A yeasty. is the date always clearly split up a different series. I like it easy to get in that the dates of the former time three I abate, so b d or b b d o o A. That's always the same group. Then after that there's umanumber like a one or two suso. At at every level every one has to be careful to rely jest, take, even if at the highest level the take stuff from one series. not much sturmferent. serious together these would robustly messes stare so so so like, Even if you make one satetake A, which has the whole corps of our corps, that would still be from one series only. But but you are producing it the moment he lay, individual takes files. That sort of. I have the raw text for a whole meeting as a holler. Yes, but I mean a M thiers, that at times I tatfor each meeting at zero, You just probably just time at them finer seconde o the tetanus or a tame We we taste, change it an A boone. Then it was that Im to a wiesatmha, a teestaother a document, M. So it is anybody creating a real rates sing at the moment, which is just the words, O, o ye A in is oaten, just Oenothera, einst. But if they are and legs, its its sudden end times just for the fire legs, the chest, the first and last line of every signal in its every single word not interesting in utterance. Yes, that depends on what you mean by chestnut. Print out there. I do disorientation, sir. I mean a est. If you're into it, Can you make a taitslak Make jest a word. Sure, do you want it straight? Loine? I would need something that marks the end of a Isis, your samaneake and the like as any in make a a o the top. It you mentioned aminta, sir. Oh, then I needn't think to frantic. anyway. I give it for now. if you oweeitosi moineayou, goin, put that as an output of yours in Tekoa, So for now, can you create A or of their dumb with you? You take Ecoute Likin dictionary, You in, work on that for you to iantation, And and you would want that all in one file for all the coppers, or for for the serious, But I call the series. I can also deal with separate files in Maine rites, The outbreak that it otsilfiles in the retrorsome thing, But I mean there, I can directly put it. so if you can put it in one single magafile, that would be quite useful for me. So only words am per meeting series. even for you, wouldn't it be as if you had different fights Because any sort of no lack, if for me it's very fine, so give me. give me different files as long as I, if you could name them in a way that is easy to enumerate over them like whatever, one, two, three for five, or something. Tat'sjust anything that I can. Yes, they will so well estate over the names Savenaye is. Is there something they easily elated to enumerate over a itemsome ordered pattern to one series is same triste tussock. Yes, so only words and words as no. I don't need the time. Suggest need the words, but I and the right or ye. You want a one? O K. I hear any man here with lit orders. I'm hard best at times and don't Yes, Sometimes they're contained in one another, so antedate mutes After when do you think you'll have a leg of primitive segmentation by some ready made topic? Citation by some ready made tool ready. I mean to Eleanor Caseine, How kak as I need that ten men in a Oakham, I think Em for all the corps is just for what I know, for my attempts at em. nine magamie bite to have means that Peter should be similar to Licorice. words, words, he magrath, other words together, Emperor, other meetings. That sounds quite reasonable. That's nine nine characters guessing over now am what I, because nine megabates is what I got for when I said for ere I'm utterance. This A goes from that to the N. Let us say, or are we? are we thinking one particular serious at the moment or I'm doing it for it is mate here. I guess we can refroces the data for different series and then check which serious is the best for the presentation. It sounds quite reasonably and make about me. If you think if it's roughly a million words and nine character Ivy words, I had little will be the same for the word is just what. I. now, Yes, I'm going to build a dictionary then, from that like just a list of the words that may be a list of the words with the frequencies, or a list of the words sorted alphabetically or numerically. But what does any one want to sit? Any wishes for dictionaries? I could see at a torrent. I think until the information density instead be reds, so I'll create a dictionary. So am I properly sent em. just one file of permeating, I'm to all those who need it so that it can ever looked at the stranger, and then the actual file became probably copy from your home directly, or somthnli. it. I mean, it's just for one teniente, but im sir, I'm saying for the whole thing. in the end, I lintieing pole shouldn't do by yea, how long would it take to make a anaiteuor from the time I get the file can do that in an often, the next or the next morning. Oh, you mean how long processing time it takes on how long you would have to be. It is box and irate Iv. five, sort of. I've written it for for dill jus in half an hour or something similar. jest, He put them in a hash table, and and say well, if it exists already in the hash table, they need grease the count by one. and I've probably implement some falter for filtering out n u or so something, because it's quite easy in parlous line of coat for counting all the words. And really I must be by ashes. Mark you were. I don't know any poleman If any one wants to do a postscript. For that he does it nicely. I, I've no problem for that, but I think I have the job coat virtually ready, because Padilla wrote something very similar like Padilla wrote something that counts there. The different occurrences of all the taxes. Have you doing it in Java? Do you and cried? Alas is writing it to file, Sir, If you dingan Java serialized at the ashtable as well as writing it to file Er, never serialized them really easy. Wouldn't that be absolutely master, sir, Don't see what'd be any more Asianfile and then Cyrilla, and then write the cyrilization to a Ile E. So you want like a, like a file, which is the cyrilization of a hatesyaa. T, part fine representation of it in. No, I'll be eating it in Java. Anyway, Shall just be building date structure again. I'll I'll check if I understand how it works. I mean, otherwise, I can give you the coat for loading a dictionary. A it's just it's it's. It's a line break separated finally over seems like a bit silly to by passing over and over again. A ye, yea. I see if I understand how to serial ise There's there's a serial as Commander, That gives me one magamother of the sort. Er. I think all the collections and things in Pevensey Blalready here, but do they automatically write to the file anyway? I'll figure that out, take point of view. Yes, that's pretty much pretty much it. So Dave and me look at how night a smell works, and we're all trying to oesework to morrow, to tide to it or to old. I think I'll build a dictionary as soon as I get the text. and yes, that when do we have to meet again? Then his. suppose that one or anon, or how are we going to do a demonstratinext week? we have to demonstrate some. what do I denono'? not demonstrably? Didn't you say that, but didn't we sort of agree that it would be useful to have a demonstrator of like some primitive thing working like I suggested. The aisle prototype has got to be very prototype of a aimeri. I gain more in. Now, let's go. I feel like like hanging in mid air and not really like finding a point where you can get your teeth into it and start working for the air, and it's all so fuzzy though ink is cos. We had to specify it ourselves that it's no likie specification of vice on you, but at the moment, but at the moment it as an imp imitation, a level I, with the data structures in us, like over these vague ideas of some treason. Once we start doing it will become more solace. It's just our half way through the project time to Velit, which just freaks me out.\"]\n"

      "[\"Good morning, every one.let us get started with our pattern programming session.To day we will be discussing about patent programming.We will looking.We, will be looking looking at the introduction.so we need to understand that height programming is open sauce,, right as it is a generalized programming language and it is used for a Gengeneric purpose, and Rick paper, and also Piton programming is scalable and it is inter active as well, and there are also other other capabilities.When it comes to Piton.it, is, we call it as a high level programming language.as with generally.we'll call it as highly will program language.And it is so, has independent meaning.Now it is portable.it can be used in different operating system.It supports different operating systems, and and there are different ones of benefits when we talk about fit programming physically, it is.it acts like a medium.It, it acts like a medium of communication.What you communicate.your computer understands what you try, to what you try to communicate, and process the data.p.When we talk about Piton, we should also know about the history of Piton.again we should also know about the history of Piton, and also we need to understand how Piton was originated, Right who originated Piton and are how P originator.There is the sky.A gentleman, s fine R in he's Dutch.this gentleman rat started developing Piton way back in Nineteen Eighty Nine, and he bit was officially released or introduced in around Nineteen ninety One, one February, look here, and Pit was made open sauced in and around the same year.If I'm not wrong,, it was.It was open sauced in and around Nineteen ninety one itself.in So we need to understand.We spoke about fighting being open. so.Right, so we need to understand.What what do we mean by open schools?What do we mean by open seas?We know that it is for free.Right, it is available for free that we understand, and when when we say free and open souls, it is not only the feature.it is not only about Piton being or available for free.There are other other other aspects also to being open soul.Let me let me talk about or let me now.give an example where I would like to put you in a hypothetical situation.no.let us say you have created a soft war.Make a person a created a soft war and you want to develop the soft war.You know, initially, when you started off with the soft were with the application, it is just an idea, right.it is just an idea.You have a soft air.You.you want you want to devil up that soft soft war further right? And then, at this stage, I would say is the beginning of it and you have a long way to go right.So when you're developing a soft car, you have two options.One is commercializing it, or make it an open source, open source that is available for all the users when it comes to commercializing this of far.What you do is you introduce it to the market and you sell it.You have a particular clients, a bunch of clients who will make money, who will invest, and they've developed, and you, also that there's also money involved in it.Ultimately you'll get rich right, but also there is another option, bridges, or B, which is available enough for free handed, a bunch of fat or ment of people developing your soft lips.\", \"Does any one want to see Yer Steve feed back from the specification?. Is there much more in it than his?. Was there much more in it than you said yesterday.. Not really... Was talking about duplication of effort like duplication of effort and stuff.., And yes, I know she may be a.. Think about having a proto tater, weak sex, which is nae... So I roeper.., Oh yes, I say, if for the prototype Fatalite, wherever possible, chant the stuff that we have a pre aneta to stuff,, and for the stuff that we don't pre anette right, like tube place line, then we should probably be able to reside that we be focus on on the inter, face first to us, so that we we take the the ready made parts and just see how we get the word to get in Antipas the way we want.. Then we have a work in prototype Nd... Then we can go back and replace pieces either by our own components or by more sophisticate con comonents of our own.. It probably felt things em away this week.. And so if we just want to have em some Tate for the use face, could I be random later?. Oh, ye ye know bout, I might like the the similarity sin M matrices itself for my stuff.. I. I. I think I can do that, Faye, because I have the well, go back first to a look at Niecksmell, to see in how far that that which we want is compatible with that with night a smell offers us, and then just sort of every one makes sure every one understands the interface.. So I think if to day we decide on what data we want to have,, now and later may be even to day.. we go and look at night, Exeter, some of us to a night expedition, Tatoes,, trying to make some ten socotand, See how does the pentation work?. The end and then soothe knowledge.. We total to an say at that to night come data.. we want a load into it, and this is how every one an access it, and then E useable o, o hoo,, o, o, o, o, o, l.. I look.. look the documentation, and I seen enough to make me think that we want to use the night emarine work, because they have got the mole that increase the sort, the data, and in every display Havana takes a lot of work away from us... Sort of that would be a reason for staying within their framework in using that general classes... but we won that.. I haven't looked at it at all, which is something we shared a way like for this whole discussion, I mean,, who of us the basic hard importance of the answer.. The combined measure might not be if we were to wait for the earnest C paniesily,, off I teastuff, tanofir, I eat, sir,. Basically, apart from the display, more that display itself, we don't have an extremely high degree of interaction between sort of our models that create the stuff and an tenteface.. The Nefas is mainly while it's running chest or omendated.., that's just loaded from a fire.. I guess, data it to a Aasearch,, Fatal Liaison, work Ye now yet the searches a gas, the searches of the strange beast anyway,, we for the search be leaving the night ex m frame work, em,. but that's still sort of.. that's good... That means at least like won't have that observation work... Somebody has to do like a billion calculations on on data on line.. That would make it a lot more like that would mean that our interferes for the data.. We have to be a lot more careful about how it performs and in every thing, and nobody is modifying that data at at on line time at all... It seems nobody is making any changes to the actual data on line, so that psyche, making it a lot easier that better to miss our browser really is a viewer.. mostly, which isn't doing much with the date except four, sort of selecting a piece it fit an, and flaying it.. We seldom go for dumping into a day's Ce... we seldom dump in a day's space while some parts relevant for the search.. Yes, I'd say so, cause if we are, I reckon we should all read our class Otis so much ieasier.. A. Well, if we go to dump their partly in dat bateau dumple, to mint the date bateato there, so we don't even have to worry that much about the Un, The long abolition, be just queer,, but nobody of us is doing much of searching from the data in the online stage, and for all together like the display itself, I think were easier if we, if it's sitting on the Ex smell, than if it sitting on the equal stuff.., it sitting on the Ex smell.., We have the the nite smell frame work with all its functionalty for synchronizing through all the different levels whenever there's a change ever an in moving forward stuff, An I, I am.. I look at the coat, like how the player moves forward and how that moving forward its resent the an weel, an stuff... I think in the actual browser itself, I don't want to sit on the curl if I can sit on the melifsiting on the ex mew... Have all we have of Uch help, and for for like the the calculations that we're doing apart from the search, it seems every one needs some special repensations anyway, A wegundy that we should try and store everything maximo forma as well even our results here in in the night, Emil smell formed, so with their time stemsuffs that it's easy to to tie together.. Things are what I'm like... Awe, have to think about it.. if we go with this multi level idea like this idea.., That, sort of,, if you start with the whole meeting series as one entity is one thing that you display is one whole.., Sort of that, then the individual chunks are the individual meetings, Whereas and then you can click on a meeting and then sort of the meeting.. ispthe whole thing, and the chunks are the individual segments.. That means sort of E have multiple levels of representation W w... probably, if we,, if we do it this way it wit sis, I do it is with an we... Sho,, probably find some abstraction models so that the face in the sense like deals with it as if it's the same that I,, as tesn't really has to worry whether it's a meeting in the whole meeting series or a segment within a meetingyou... Now what I mean and that's probably stuff that we have so flake process twice.. Then like from that like the summary of a meeting within the whole meeting corpus, or meeting... Seriously, a meeting.. Seriously,. good word that I don't really know what how to call it you... Now what I mean like not not the whole corps, but every meeting that has to do wits one topic.. I'm so in in the meeting serious, so that a summary for a meeting within the meeting series, a sort of compiled off land by a summary model, and that is separate from a summary of a segment within a meeting.. as I don't think we can.. Well, we don't even need.. And us, we got our notation that the coat off line.. So we do try the whole lot as one massive document in a Not we so big we can to denainformation that the fever acres into sunrise.. Based on that, I thought we would just have played one big summary.. M was only a different importance levels em displayed on it... and depending on what our zulevies would just as play a part of it, so are we doing that at all levels Ave, em, and would have one very big things of life, and from that we would just select at owes leanest a different, like fine greatnesses levels.. Sort of yes,, so for example, you would M give high value to those M sequences.. Yu want toula the Etang series Summerso,, The only this that cat of a, So the only thing that would happen E if I double click latifrom,, the whole meeting series on a single meeting is that the sum level changes like the the start in the end position changes and the sum level changes.. That was what I saw.. I age envoy.., I thought we couldn't do that.. I was under the impression that we couldn't O that we cow couldn't load the date of all that, but I don't know... I mean that.. I think there's very much pointing like that when it's just to feed off in the end the information dentataey and that's all calculate off line is all you're really doing its sort... List This the competition a hard part of it, so I'm sororities.., I,, aamation of it is refractory in a ease... you do?. I say.. if I set a tea or a whole doctorate, alienated and the lay.., So a iteration.. the Eliautes so trained to a A Ow.., I was just worried about the total memory complexity.. It, but a aridaeus sort of like to that from some thing that Jonathan one said about not loading everything, but maybe have a wrong... but an when you piatink.. The difference might be that we would just what we have A the words.. and that's not so much phat He meant was a possibly loading everything was heeled or the annotation stuff or the son fits.. Or we think we have stout an intense for words that cleeverycin the word yet, but it, ma, it might, but it might sound crazy in the play.. We should.. really.. maybe we can do that together at some point to day that we checked out how the play works, I think, but there's may be some merit and altogether tinge utterance that am gettin quite samanon us... an.. what's an our difference between the m s e, the importance measure and the coming.. I mean to be to both us the same thing while the skin is kin engaged in Portobello on Anne,, talk bout summary Should talk about this, but about skimming about about Boleski.., What, but also about the displays.. I mean the displaced, in't the in the text body in the in the latest draft that we had of Wecameov,, with the idea that it isn't displaying utterance utterance,, it also displaying a summarised version in you... No like below there below the grape part, ye may,. maybe yes, if it isn't that the ski n't isn't that to Sim?. Oh yes, it's just like that, this like audio skimming, and this displayed skimming, never to same data as ye... maybe there's some merit of going altogether fatternc, Lee or pother to calculate.., I mean, if you have to do it internally than you can do, but may be like not stored the importance level or individual words.., An just sort of rank utterances as a whole,, noisy oolitic is no more like Yes, simians... it might be better skimming in less memory required at the same time.., An... I mean, if you, if you know how to do it for individual words than you can, just in the words, gettecan't, in in tinges maman of the words of the utterance,, Now at Im an not quinet.. You want to do just antosignd.. What's the smallest chunk at the moment You think of of signing an importance, Mature worter trance.. I thought about words... so we're thinking of like, maybe just storing it on an utterance level because it's it's less stuff to store.., Probably for Dave, in the in the audio, Playing any for in the displayed folly.., Better if you hold utterances, then I don't.. Nola's like you just take single words out of utterance That probly doesn't make any sense, overishow important utterance, but the utterance a whole mats more tense.. It doesn't make Mak a different, or your otanes us means that if you work on a word level than each mean it over... I think we are so out about commanding that medoro.. Some times I get me a hot pot.. They are all that word out so beyond a... That's good... Any weals at Makes the olsen put it on oratorio, I, I ailie.., Oh yes, no, I mean like how, I just mean, does it in Nyon now, but it's probably a you prate work on word levels for importance, but there should be ways of easily going from a word level to an utterance, Al reckon e about the you profess, I, I think I should, ever as a race over over whole utterance the words and there are quite an import here, oporto words as weel.. I think we should, just as I orate should have it cut off so word only get a Voltaire.. So anything that has a oooorta, one zero, for we do prelltring,, a sort of a hole.. Eat of likely,, but that, like the problem with that, is it easy to do in the text Devil, but that would mean it would still play the air in your audio unless we sort of false or store word we cut out for the audio.. Yea.., I think before we can let answer that specific question how we deal with it, it's probably good for us to look at what the audio play is capable of doing... I think of to offer audit.., I think it'll be very hard.. Think it'll be an hour or two's work... So what do you mean by puffing the ethie directs, feeling an another.. I e that patient There, No,, but not stored on the hard... testing, the loaded in, but loaded indirectly from memory, or suggest by An that I, a menial way or osier juror at is covetous Tom,, Inari,, freen, O,. In in a Ieiaea, he must have a casserole as assassination.. I guess I mean so that means that that, probably I. If you go on utterance level, there's still some merit on within utterance.., he's cutting out stuff which clearly is relevant at all, and that may be also for the audit.. Have,, or let's say we play the whole phrase.. But then in addition to that we have some information that says Minus that prosaic.. That's the car that win you.. Oh, I think a mitraille as a class just feel list firm.. the. oh yes,, because then we can also do the display about who's speaking.. We also really won't be on search... by, He is speaking as well here, but I am still confused because I thought like that chess would drown us that, but that we can't do like lodemassive document of that size.. but dear me,, tail, the calculations don of l the other end, I mean it shouldn't be like Blkeaftifty, Magabite, and Rumanian, I m to last fifty hundred magabit.., It's quite if thinking what this in?. So we do get an arrow message Was the project... If we load every thing into the project with all the data they load, so we know that doesn't work... So our hope is essentially that we load lesson to it.. What's this lazy loading thing?. Somebody explain lazy loading to Winston is a Laetitia file... It was in a... So that is that only by type of file... If if if the same thing is in different files, wot then may be like I.. Now.., If if utterances are split over three or ten or one hundred different files is,, then a chance at it doesn't try to load them one memory, the same tamasese tites,, But what is it?. Fail then in the first place, and it should ever fail to ten... It should never be to eat or to a A themal.., Yes, but am I it fail t... load it.. Rieti.., Is that at that in as I defend Bacolod,, For example, it lots all the utterance I ans one... but it doesn't loam the does cos e s e a lot as a as a butt summaries.. Not to let's check it out, and I'll I'll probably ask Jonathan about it.. so alternatively, if we realize that we can't do the whole thing in one go, we could probably just process some sort of meta data in a vermilikes, or sort of for the whole series chunks, representing the individual meetings of some, like something that represents the whole series in in in a structure very similar to the structure which we represent individual M meetings, but with date, a sort of always combined from the whole serious.. so instead of having a single utterance that we display would probably be like that would be representing a whole am topic, a segment in a meeting at... So so that using the same day you mean that you m these that a bathing in two different summaries rinses that you have a very Am topple, a summary and a separate five for ruchothinki.., In a sense like creating a virtual, a virtual meeting out of the whole meeting, serious, sort of as I see justice,, a new bodye, sort of like off line, create a virtual meeting, which, which Beattie treats the meeting series as if it was a meeting and treat the individual meetings within the series as if they were segments, and treats the individual segments with in meetings as if they were a utterances.., You now, so just so we shifted one level up,, and in that way we could probably use the same algorithm, and just like make Verite one or two.. If that say K,, If you are on a whole document, a whole serious leveled.. that was a double click, then don't just go into that a segment, but Lo the new file or something like it,, but in general use the same agreein, Vernie can't aylo the whole thing.. And because I'll selig, even if we maybe this whole leg, maybe I'm worrying to much about the whole series.. In one thing, this play because they yean probably use us.., Wouldn't you?. that on two of Anaitis,, eat at Rome is to his tea.., Haines is will the off lying stuff as any as I, and all we can do is is out o the thing I,, as some riata on a hundred or esdaile in Ettie,, I, to one partridges at other etais e s in one already I, some resourceless, and then in a r. Yes, but am ill word.. let Rome for the display, If you,, actually, if you want a display, the leg for the whole series.. their information density levels based on an end, and the only granularity you have is individual utterances,, Temanite go to every single at rents in a series of seven hours.. a Na store man lately seene me so then if you make that structure very similar to the Della,, one level down, like the way, have or individual utterances stuff that a vein more... this encounters a F. U. I sent stuff so,, but still so in general we having we having utterances, and they have a score, and that's as much as we really need.. And and they also have a time time information, of course,, speaker and Elise,, and aster information, a topic and need as well,, Yes,, and information.. which topic they are in here,, and and probably separate to that and information about the different topics sat, so so the skimming can work on that with the skimming chests out of sorts,, the utterances, and put as many in as walenn... O, preserve the order when it is late. ye, ye it... it'll play them in some order in which they were set, because otherwise it's going to be more entertaining.. A., But that that's enough data for the skimming, and that the searching, so he,, searching those searching leaves the whole flame.. Work goes to the Esquildata base, and gets like, Bettine gets just a time mark for where that is,, like that utterance that you're concerned with, and then we have to find them here... There's some way in, and Nada's matches, say that position to that time mark, and then it shifts the whole frame in the alert, every single element of the display and the display up dat I oroetes, or Ooohere here that ties.. So if if some so so,, if in that tree display somebody like on some thing, each nettie frame stump here and then you sort of that that time Tameto and the Naticell Central managed that Central manager, alert every thing that star like alert tsampa that hot display, alert the Tsplarlrt, the italiplay, and that we have a new time, Pray,, and then they all sort O to the up the reins with respect to the current level of sums, or how much they display than starting position at... We're there, or maybe the mid position of it.. I don't know... Like if you start with thing was found, or if that thing to was found is in the middle of the part that we play that I don't now.. what that we a deid about it.. general, sort of, it's the same thing... If like whether you play, it moves forward over the you jump... our position.. searched, He sely for all the window, handling it the same event.. It's only that the event gets triggered by the search ratin with Tenement and says, please go there now... So we you playing like or that Eldon memory De everyone model changes that rather than the underlying date, and then have that excel... An I elaborate, tied to the interlace, Why do we have it in memories that start you to make a fire.., If you want.. I mean, like the information is coming from off lines, sir,, We probably don't even have to change the utterance document rice,, because the whole way, like the whole beauty of the Naticmel, is that it ties together lots of tirailleurs rat,, an additional malpais for every utterance, like the utterance of ideas,, assume some references, so we just we tie a just very short mephitis, the only information it has.. it has whatever a number for.. for there an wait for the information that the atostie that to the existing utterances and tie them to the existing speaker changes.. But there's no idea for in Etienne,, individual word, so how do we do London,, know it or or it as well, I think it's is one... Well, so we have segment portal.., Yes, Well, otherwise we'd probably have to go over in like add some integer that we just increment from top to bottom, sort of every ohrante, as and as an idea, sometime or on,, or try to understand how Natica ideas work.. And maybe there's some special rule to as of follow when we use these ideas, Emperours,, already there, Pretoria,, the thee... Our ones are numbered, even to the girls,. say, the utterances themselves are not numbered at the moment... I am not quite sure... I have only seen that there the individual words, a lady,, so I guess it would be solvable... if not.., Yes, you always could have a look at the time, Stepan,, and take the one step along together to form an entrance.. I think you'd just take the segments that are already if they are.. I, e, the exigencies,, Amnon,, the ex men in it, said a port mark, a pen.., I just like to make a list of all the stuff away, for we can somebody,, do the paper only fancy,, and the wood to the stuff we have... we have utterances and speakers and wait for utterances, for for every utterance that of late the utterance has a speaker, and a wait is coming from outside or which is tied to it, And there is segments which they are after a seeress play... I was so sorry ye... that's a term is topic segments.., I meant like they're They're super units... So so the utterances are tied to topic segments.. And if the time stamps are on a word level, then we somehow have to extract time stamps for at rents where they start there... there, time am em for the segments, em whar segments, now um segments,. For example, when when you look at the data W displayed in one line, when when you is the same as a Francis,, Is that the same as utterances that Elise?., they may not be exact... A amfortas.., am I, I competed, or were for the pause in duration, extraction, Am,, and physically, it's a words that are uttered in a seance without pauses, But sometimes, however, there are a shauauses,, aether indicated by a waitspausau... That's a.. but that's one... one second as a two seconds.. the I'm sometimes that the annotators headed what was once a tent.., What was a key?. I cast word,, But generally utterances is that which we just called a sorry segment, is that which we just call utterances.., Now I got a idea, sort of sages... One person's contributed a time sort of thing, in yes, o, yes, we have those, and thine have some field somewhere else which has topics to Yes,, an th topics... Thesily,, they are just an idea, probably with a start time or something... And and the utterance is reverence to those topics.., He has his.. The topics don't contain any redundance... Think of la ting the whole topic, and at the assort of say a number, and where they start in where they finish, and the utterances, and they which topic he belong to, the vain, Einesome invitations, some anaitis,, and someone Asako o on... So he and Abe was thinking of the topic segmentation Now in inuefor,, that there would only be one retains of like pictures, a time window out... So if this lazy loading works and this should definitely fit in, too.., I mean not memory, then, because it wouldn't all be memory at the same time.., So if each has have to of that information, like a long list of all the utterances, slash segments,, and like short or smaller lists which give weight to them, and even the.. probably, if there's a lot of overhead in having two different files, we can probably merged the weights into it off line... Now what I mean like if if there's a lot of bureaucracy involved with having two different trees and whether one ties to the other because the one has to wait for the other than is prob quicker to just a white, just right as near a mail can night handle just right... In arbitrary, a new tostoff, I alter.. to a yet, though there was the whole beauty that, like you can just make a new expel file, in sort of tithe to the other end, and in avoiding a eared, Oh yes, sir,. no, I didn't.. I didn't mean tree.., No, No, I mean us like, and in toto ile in r, I was just thinking like if if the overhead for having the same amount of data coming from foot files instead of from one file is massive, then it would probe Frosty's, just like Off line, Put there the way I, too, into the file that has Testament.., I,, Yes, it as the ansarey,, but that we can figure out a rantipole thing is out either passion, I panier,, passion as pastoral.. yet, yes, you know we we be completely using like the Holierenc ruined.. Just, I mean, the main difference welten our protean tears real, is that we load a different part of the data.. Otherwise we dinginesame way that they are doing.. I, so e, just were of running different totoqueries,, or ewen, Irene, I think we are running queries is not just about em... what we load In awe.. Don't oo well, running queries in the Senate, Dynamite, select by by weight on... then we have to check how fast that is that. To say, give us all the ones that.. whether that works with their query lang wee, whether that will result in hate, We yo know.. If if I let say a mine, if their quarry language is strange, and if I would return ten million results in, I can't handle it, then we can just write our individual components in the way that they know what... what the return?. the?.. So they still get all the data and jus Saturnali, say or no,, this is less than we are at Pathetay,, a son in.. I mean price,, to see the injustice in chunks.. ye... no, I will.. I'm just thinking for this whole thing of like a different level, sort of cutting out different different pieces.. Whether we do that sough a quarry, where we say, give us everything that's above this and this weight,, or whether we keep the same in frenstruction,, but every individual model, like the player and the display say like they still get sort of all the different utterances all the different pieces, but they say all this piece I leave out to pause... It's below the current threshold, Lethean Polidore, I'm sorry, I pull store a hierarchical information and sit as well with and in fomentation tensity score for each meeting and each topic in an otherwise will be re... calculate sane thing over over over and thereover tree... and thou obvious eater is, when do we need the one for the meet?. A man.. Now who meiayer?. I guess For the so, when we have tisplavor, we display the whole series... Then if we have for the individual topic segment within the meetings, we have ready calculated, I am Methane,, don't have for of extract that the from the dividual utterance, Ye, that's also fairly, is to store along with our segments for the segments.. Are we extracting some type of title for them that we craft it from fancy a gret mamanally of each as taking the single most highly valued key word utterance for the segment Heading to all we can starve By that.. I was going to start off copy three and twenty one... That does just it, and then just change that to work over... It's probably like an end.. Probably it wouldn't be the best thing if it's just the high most highly ranked praise key word.. Go take for example, for an introduction that would most definitely not be anything that has any title.. Any were similar to introduction, Sonia, O stuff,, O,, worse,, and the key word, so also I,, for this part may be if we go over it.. Nadentity, me enimme y e.. One of ideal has some name Eti Tico to spare,, and he like this for thee,, for sort of for finding topics.., Titles for for segments jus take a named entity which has a really high.. What's it called deader?. You'd probably be quite likely to talk about a conference or a person that that would be named entity, which is very highly fomenter portion O Amedee Yathodaya, his at there, quisarsor,, that taine tone, other facing to a oeceneral alacielike,, especially if there's parponamed entities I describe, or the ortasegent asapou wourali, be quite to like if there's some name of M. conferen,, that would probably sathaname of the Cornaro, May to ride the tea in direct reference to it, he, he said, he said,, Yorkicarrent, in meaning that I, I, it's not here.. I derisively.., it's release release.., It's just look for a place.. La, put to a job or well,, A was working A. A, seating the honor on a pervert level, on again and then at... It's not like related to the orators, just conon trees on a kick.. I was just wondering where he had the corpse for a at t moment.. No, So it it seems that the data structure isn't a big problem, and that Basia, we don't have our, have all these massive discussions of how we exactly intact the data structure because most of our work isn't done with the data structure in memory in the brows, but it's just done off line and every one can represented anyway.., They want a long... Estesov, store it in a tete re et in the end, so it may be useful to know how I restore that thing.. Say yet that would mean understanding.. Then I'd Alexelzorov formed in Lomordito.., We should.. I think we should just have a long session in the coved room together.. like now that we know we more, would we want?. Take a closer look at Miago, mellowed a few hours,, the other as a father to enter the Ataman Ance stand, Then he there, there's a furore, and then I, Isaacson,, and take on the car... the Italic utterance segment ten, is, and they are numbered A s... You haven't looked at the Tudor Alice, and one day said to a Ihaelsie, said An A as an amain at a quiver.. Who's whose sort of doing there?. The central coordination of of of the brows application are like a integration time integration year, but also like all these elements, like, like the loading and a integration, and and like handling the data loading and stuff, don't we think Anne's been like I do it... I'm sort of like.. I think I'll take over there display just because I've started with a bit and found it.. He found it durable at a, so somebody should sort of be the one person who's who understands most about what's centrally going on with wither with the project like wither, wither, browser or Holland,, where the data comes in.. And so my poring task is also complicated by a cat, but difficult.. I won't move.. I guess we can do it like several pee together.. Probably just those people have to work together.. a lot of very close interest.. Make sure that they always understand what taher an doing.. I guess the important things together resolutely Stadesimple legende,, an organ already made versions of them for that matter, and here the may be a a me you, but I think I eletthe moment integration comes first to that sort of it.. The moment the building the browse comes first, and then only comes the creating new sophisticate data Huns... Because that sort of the wolf thing about having a prototype system, which is more,, let's working on on trunk data.. but it Talavera, A,, within ten, everything in and look at everything as before we have that it be very difficult for any one to really see how much the work at that agitating sense.. O,, just well, I guess you can see something from the data that you have in your individual Amelius,, that you create it.. I would be nice to have some days on it Thusia stuff... So may we should try doing something really simple, like just as playing a home meeting, and like just being a scroll through it or something like that,, or just a depth like the Le,, sort of go from their system and an ad at peace for peace, and see how we can how we could arrange a lake adapted to our system.. Does any one want you like to sit with me and like play for three hours with attic smell.. At some point, Are you free of this?. I wouldn't like to be, But like I got Jim, I'm theoretically free.. but if there's any time of Friday, some of a Friday,, I have nothing to P on Wednesday, Ay a Wednesday on one till twelve, nine till twelve In the nothing you have very early afternoon... I got nothing in the afternoo Any time wins day afternoon.. I. I cake.. So we're about just enough in town, Ya forest till whatever one sees to disgust a fee.. I'll be in the Aetolian,, Kay... what time do yo want Yo A? well, be there from a goatee on on that last of your other o ketill,. Just meet you in eighteen in the afternoon.. I guess at the moment nobody critically depends on like the nite smell stuff working right now, right like a moment can all do the stuff and I can do my others a stuff, and I can even do the displayed to a vast degree without tactically having the supplying framework work in... So it's not that cruciaul a Iowa, Wetona, To I, a. Oh,, I have to see in a diety, I need erotic, says William. I was.. I was more thinking of the sort of third del brows or frame work as a running programme.. Now you see, I think we all need erotics and different in different flavours to be a eaters... You... the beatitude on only just got to Ottaviano,, to a ton.. Pity, I think is quite easy... I otasite parsee,, some Aeolian team is to so onsartain in on in the order, you you?. I that.. what?. as I thought.. Yes, Yes, combine them in the order the as.. Yes, that's a potential I was going to amuse... and what I found out was stickin that they are quite a lot of things without without an temps in the beginning.. What fails?. Yes, Yes, I, others yet that's just an idea or thing, and every there's word has time tempts them.. Yes,, but what are the other things?. That's some kind of number?. Many Tafia Numerian is in the beginning.. What is that?. to think?. There are quite a lot of numbers in the beginning where there is no time stamp or bumbers... they say ye,, quite a lot of numbers before the Er... The is number number... Within the Ex Mel context, Ye are numbers and the helter, the.. Are they spoken number like, Do they look like their utterances?. Yes, Ether's the number task, isn't there?. That's part of the thing, but at the end, maker and beginning as well as I. I. I read Les say If we have to be counted out anyway, for our progeny,, know so we going to screw up a lot of our data... A no, Not sure if it were as, I think it wouldn't as first.. I mean, it would curse every meeting.. It would probably make the tea.. if you, Samantha, pray, I think I, even its own annotation like iteration.. I, er, easy... and just think that prod prod, probably like the Elise, would perform quite well on.. It would proudly find another number task quite easily.. eye a constrained vocabulary with a high co currents of the same nine words to the iteration of a notion.. I think it's all something that they.. They set the numbers in order right... They've to read numbers yet.. I think it... it sounded like they wanted to check out how well they were doing with overlapping the stuff, because Vasily, it's like they're reading them at different speeds.. but you know in which order they are set... And if I didn't have a look at that, so Ixe had some reasons for doing it as to insist saying leg numbers at the end of the room, and also a very different com combinations of letters, The Aryans, something,, and that is everything ordered... Are the times stems global, or are they local and an A. The Dave,. If you are eclaircissement,, Well, if you are doing, I des, or whatever you call your, your frequent is or eunane.., You need some dictionary for that.. At some point the like o need that some representation of a word as not not that specific occurrence of the word token,, but of of of a given word for become an account, the word of the linga diction.., Yes, we should work together in that, resigning the dictionary as well.. I must just can easy a hush, a one in a job as a moneyed asmodeuso of until we amatooony, you sign to O... Didn't you say that to Asiaticus, Yes,, or a forefather whole thing.. It is some where the two sat That them here, some programme that out a diary, roared Rainbow.. It's Oi... think it's just economise.. Is any one of you for the For the Dominican free, You can I have to frequent for then that right leg over the whole carnage to the Oand... so I will only count for each in a initiation.. It was rain as a Isaiahink.., It is not possible to have as a boon lyes a act like like that, copies of Shakespeare's Yes,, sure, you're sure we could do that, but I don't know if that makes sense, Cause, if as if we were looking for a frequentation, How that change A?. We need just what wines manichees acute using to, or there may be another to it.. It's quite easy to just count on a one on frequency Using which to lay it up is using a per script.. Be careful with that lie... My experience.., Wha Bode national corpo was that there's far more word types than you ever think.. Cause, any thing that sort of unusual generally is a new word type, like any type, or any strange thing where they put two words together, and also any number is a word type of its own, so you can easily end up wi a hundred thousands of words when you didn't expect them, So so generally dictionaries can grow bigger than you think they do... No, I don't.. I am a Probation Roy recital lecture.. Lepresion in a sane consist of one, Did it ten gibier.., If it consists any special characters, An give erbisome in a otteausy,, not one... When I happened in, I remember who's got it mighty word that at one of these he cut out a less to stop words E outright, and let us be either uninteresting, boring words that we cut filter out before we do that.. I like that on the papers.. I read that the one thing they did write beginning as they've got the thinkstop list, and they just tignore all these, but I did for my protege, just ignored their hundred most frequent words because they actually end a bold being articles,, then tied everything it done... so we need take.. several of us need a dictionary, and I the only one who need tear it in... I, I be useful for May as well,, am I the only one who needs it with frequency, sir,, I, I, I, a useful orequeney.. Well, I guess as soon as we have the road tack, we can probably just start with a cover, hash, map and leg, just hash up over it and see how far we get them in, Can probably on a machine with a few hundred macabram... You can go quite far.. Can run it on beef, Ee... If if it goes wrong in it, If doesn't never a Latin to gain some Susie out ice, An I hate on dice C, I I machine, or you're burning it on A.. like, we should be able to burn the hole.. I was just Lecoell,, You see, I see.. I ask support about that two days ago in the informati building there as Erin, in Apple Tower Fife,, the one closest two machines closest to the support of Soi, presume, However, I have the exact I think you tackle of the ones that Elroy and Coleyif, You enter the big room in the right hand corner, I think, and the thing is like you can only burn from the local filey, Tom,, to if it's from.. Well, actually think if it's mounted, you can directly burn the unrove my data on beef.. And so I have to get it into the local tempt director in on it from there.. but you can burn from there.. How big is it Without a?. Are we look at that?. now?. I've whiles we look at it and I forgot, because I could just say it.. I m going over a sea Ee one night to sleep it going all night.. If I had to an wished B to get at it, I don't think it was.. I don't think it was a gig about in the wave the Oise again.. See, I would off... I would offer you to get it on this one and then they copied.. For you know what I figured out, I'm quicker down loading over broad bandage, Ma than using this harvest... There's something strange about the way how they axes the Hartes, how they mounted, which is unfortunate.., I'll see I can me... What operating system do you have?. Of course, lines, Orsini,, What connection do you have at home?. O... Yes, So if any one of us gets it, we can then just use excite.. I can get burnt city or put it on on hard... just whatever question is,, if you're not quicker, if you cause, you should get massive compression out of that like fifty percent or some thing with a good... agree. So if you could compress it and just put in to attempt Roseen of space is the tempered.. The temps usually have to dig about free... Really the temps here Like I mean, there's no guarantee that anything's taste, but overnight it'll stay and I think the temps usually have Ay... but that would have to be the tempt directory of the machine Nesses agent to direct the office,, as I, I can do it from that session on infers from a remote section as sane, es.. Yet that they probably hate you for doing it, but they told me they'd like you more if you sit into another computer... computer it there and then sort of copied it into their into the gateway machine...

No, I think I saintsinte some machine here and then just see being it from here to your home machine Ere Amiaskashi... I haven't.. I haven't figured out how to tunnel through the gateway into another Leslie... It's not.. It's not easy... Definitely, that's why I end up sort of copying stuff it... The tempt directory at the gate, the machine.. So as this poring, everybody else did as how to get stuff home from we... Just look at that together.. when we're meeting.. I am a testa one.. So who's the doing me the frequencies on the words, because I, I think I will.. also, I could also make us of it for the agreement.. Disagreement in because I am I, a anitoo.., Am using thee, just cause acts first and am than in theories I found looking for work at Ananoso,, Am I would,, for example, he, the am, most fret frequent words, We so few all the out as soon as somebody gives me the rod text of the whole thing I can probe, just implements, like a five Landover Hash table frequency dictionary Bill rents ye, but I need it for my tent.., I ought. no,, O,. Did you not say frequenters in hole, sort, yavi,, I, I would like to look at the free word in my.. I'm in the regions of tet.. I found out to be interesting, so I wouldn't need it.. It would have to be re, calculated.. Art have landed yourself here.. But first, how big the chunks?. how big are the trunks to a?. A?. I think it be now as a bigger as a Atuona are quite.. that's quits... my dates.. Just some addresses You is just the same thing we used to build that the test to that one line.. So I ould a little Haitians, ame toyes,, So I would probably just concatenated on my iamais, En.. that's an aeon of. Oh, You don't want to have different counts for a chance,, Like four for something from all chunks.. Yes,, oh ye... no... that's yes... Once I write on a leg.., If I write like an Agrawich,, does a hash am table dictionary with frequency from a raw texts in the rate can be anything..? So how far are we?. How far are you getting rate of ficoing and I can get all the ataxia to be at so O ka wo.. that's good, because for the dictionary he order does Megiddo.., So yes, so an I'll get that from you and I'll write a hash table which goes over that Ingrate dictionary file... So for the dictionary isn't Oki,, do whatever word blank frequency, as some think, just could everybody thought of start from that.. I mean, I g a eat Tyde the one.. It's in what implements Man was information gain... I'm not quite sure how they calculate that I use frequent... You be useful.. I think Yes, I need pretence for depending on the contest, the size and what we consider a document in an acacia anacange, which I thinking about, but I think we might have a lot in common.. What a cactus. I, from my latent medic analysis need like counts of words within the document within a second.. Ace within a topic.., Aeetes was an wooin.., Just get footfalls or foliated, Convert his probity, that to frequencies I with. So that's what rain bodes his hat... What les a bills When I get Ilse document by friends, matrix scoperta, Amer,, but I already have.. I already have my coat to build it up myself... mandate my coat.. A M yesterday you said you need the frequent accounts.. Actually, hooray, sure for a document, but you say not for the whole world... we need the raw.. frequents... Well, the we also need how many times things occur within each document and what we consider a document and depend on our context.. I think as if we're looking at the whole lot of meetiings or an inert me documents in material good in initiate in eats small.., Ocianyou,, might look E as a small document.. It more and more appears to me that if we, if we scrape the notion of the meeting as an individual thing,, a sort of see meetings as a topic segments... and I've thought of like hierarchic topic segmentation instead, then it like a note here in framework, the nation thought of how, and.. Maybe it doesn matter.. Matter may be. if you just do it once at the highest level, it be fine, but just think it might be difficult... contained of line for a fan levels E might want... If Wigan allow disjoint.. Said example, how we didn't know Oo, in contact any tie... I suppose if you just did it globe,, treating and meeting as a dotation, et ire work out fine because you'd only be comparing it.. Eoethen.., are we using this M for there, for they're for the dock for the waiting in the end.. Now this this measure you're calculating?. I do no thought we can ease at the end is the information that, A. Because if we drink a thing for for the information density, we we should calculate it on the lowest level on the highest poietes... A man like yer word,, or cross the whole lot.., I mean by highest, cross the whole coast,, but I don't yet to let go, sort of like for in a document were is the whole thing?. Isn't that how it works that you like every politico?. I don't think it a cold, a feasisn't.., it lethabek that to change over it be different topic segment more that they talk about something different in each T segment.. Possibly, that's what relative term frequencies about their lay... In some context, their talking more about a certain word than general.. There would more be there the topic segment then... And that's what I thought as well that you.. that probably the topic segment level is the most probable.. The men.. are they big enough to get the problem at?. No, So I'm just wondering if there's ways to abandon the whole concept of of meetings in sort of,, but just not really treating separate meetings as too much of a separate enters... No, not Etiennette,, and at a al we still want to have like a notion of meetings for the Us... Yes,, but on a rhythmic level, whether we,, whether there's some way to just represent meetings as the top, Just why you want to look at you jammed together in Trenofile, And that's your meeting me a bit o me come frivolity.., I don't see why that really be poathat's.. Not really what I meant That I think I tuthink more about what I meant.. Refuse to put it so basely, Santin,. taken arbitrary are data riata.. Albeit doesn't matter concept, What dates Ioua meeting ud be to ouimemeeting, plus half a mean from somewhere else, And I'm not so, and I'm not so concerned about them... A meeting so on Ting, as in war to a like yet,, keeping keeping the same agreein the same way of handling it, just saying like just this, This topic here happens to be like a whole meeting in it, as of some topic as that... So topic is a hierarchical concept, Lie a topic,, but there can be super topics... Topics in the super topics are in the end waltemeetings, or in general, At some level super topics are treated like like topics... An, think it easily, meleese, jubilant amati,, And if you want it down the gale, and then if you want next level a jiparent.., So I am like just aeolian watering Elsinikea,, a wine on a aeolike wi import,, To be sure,, as long as like the ogre designed them with that in mind,, and in a so that I craigendarlike say you had the it safe from meeting it.. You've got like a a a hierarchy That that was quite this,, and let the utterances come off, he may be.. and when whatever your algitha's dirty, As long as when you're workin at utterances, you go for all the leaves.. Like then,, if you need something that up, so like a topic to hear.. But if you are looking it, say this on Ike.. you won't like this.. I see.., I say you'd start the leaves, and you go are on a topic.. I. I. I go... An they're up.. See Anan.., Then if you're working it, just the topics.. I, ten there, I see anything you have to worry about,, And like each tine you want to hire Level Jarberye.., The song's you're arguin... Respects that, then we can just process any arbitrary.. it. No, I ever, or So, that would be the curious as a whole that would Piso of Matteo,, me mamma,, Mamma,, bid, brain Damietta,, on beating others to together with you again and and over it again, I think as long as you build an alcove, and a respect, whatever structure is in the file,, wrather than imposing its own structure,, So so all is is like is this,, and this structurally, then always identical.. Well, not so that I can be that we can treat it with a se, or I mean it is manas ye want wi this obada, but may be say so... Then you start with all your utterances here, and when you go out to get topics, even you go to H. h. H. H.. That might be a bit confusing, Tho you have things on different levels.. I am also not sure how we can go from from bottom up out over... so to say, more than a... what can't think of it a moment?. Probably this is all too complicated worrying about that that. T see anything else to discuss Now Have have we have we decided anything on any the toss Wednesday, When did we meetin in at there at their implementation In some more etoitand stand whatstgoing on to see a man, Rasselas.., the things I together, yet two things from their stuff... Jeomake,, Sure that we are like some standard we, and standard enough to to modify it is in ratio etiolor code. Maybe he's well lay.., see about it.. How would you do that by just making La read right for every one K, who is most free in there there, said he.. I for got rid manicure everything on my seat a trois.. or we... Alternatively, we can probably just make another directory on the beefy scratch space... in that's rhyme.., having gigabot g stuff at the moment.. Is that guarantee to stay?. No, No,, and we can not succeed.. Then we can get space.. May we should send a support for.. but I think if I sent a O., some working.. If he sent support, he'd probably be listen... Bute I'm sure had a deal vitae here, cause that'd be pretty useful as if we had a big directory sailor transferring.. A No,, having said that we allow a E asked.. I think he said yes, that.. I think that was like it when we was still in the seminar room.. I asked at once, or like asked... Is it possible to get it off and nobody said it.. People are discussing, but detecting the practicalities,, but nobody said anything about our being allowed her not allowed..? I mean we have access to it here, and I guess it probably means that we.. we can't give it to anybody else.. But if they give us access to it here, or sitting on a dice machine, then that she Teresita.. It on a letter.. I personally don't have too many friends to tea.. getting in any.. Iii.., Hated, Really decided pirate copied the etaieanitat ed Meeta, Shall we eager a moment?. Yes, I, I am what I am.. he outraging.. I lie I him... Now, what would be best at the moment it sees Justine?. I think that I be very similar to what he did for my M., Em.., I expect to imitate wou abet,, to tinge to a cat to get you.. I am for each meeting I that as from An, this militates mi to was as seen of words,, and so on.. And so that's just changing to an end of old.. And if you like to, so you do you extract the words?. The more I am.. Yes, so far I extracted em the Dr. duration, but it's from the words I, so I jus t M. Prince Cut concatenated em the words instead of the durations, And it ud, I mean to be very, said, or I can try to do it. And at a cantata, I, Well, it makes it so much more.. Have we already extracted from all the files Now?. I mean, I just let it run over the first... You also order Yes,, word word, ward editor, Yes, sir,. I was, According to the S. What I just realize, we should really keediffriend series completely separate for virtually all purposes.. Let's be careful about that because, but the like that the Sic isn't one meeting series, several meetings series, Its different people meeting for let differentings Ye and I have one wadi... Give you would be one I, for I it for each meeting, and Ye are not for you, Teosgawa, like it... Let's just be careful that what ever we orto be urged together that leg at the highest level of marching.. It's not the whole Ti corpus, but individual serious on one by Fontesome, who so cosiei thin.. we might exterior... It's Robbie somewhere like well, or something like An... I think we might just get away with for the whole project.. Just like looking at only one serious and jesting within one serious... I mean, you can do everything you want in one.. S.. I mean that's one serious... Lethe's one meeting.. a ya.., Is the date always clearly split up a different series.. I like it easy to get in that the dates of the former time three I abate, so b d or b, b d o o A... That's always the same group.. Then after that there's umanumber like a one or two suso.., At at every level every one has to be careful to rely jest, take, even if at the highest level the take stuff from one series... not much sturmferent.. serious together these would robustly messes stare so so so like, Even if you make one sat A, which has the whole corps of our corps, that would still be from one series only.. But but you are producing it the moment he lay, individual takes files... That sort of.. I have the raw text for a whole meeting as a holler... Yes, but I mean a M thiers,, that at times I tatfor each meeting at zero, You just probably just time at them finer seconde o the tetanus or a tame We we taste,, change it an A Boone.., Then it was that Im to a wiesatmha, a see a document, M.. So it is anybody creating a real rates sing at the moment, which is just the words, O, o ye A in is Oaten,, just Oenothera, einst.. But if they are and legs, its its sudden end times just for the fire legs, the chest,, the first and last line of every signal in its every single word not interesting in utterance.., Yes, that depends on what you mean by chestnut... Print out there.. I do disorientation, sir... I mean a est... If you're into it, Can you make a taitslak Make jest a word.. Sure, do you want it straight?. Loine?. I would need something that marks the end of a Isis, your Samaneake and the like as any in make a a o the top.. It. you mentioned aminta, sir... Oh, then I needn't think to frantic... anyway.., I give it for now.. if you oweeitosi moineayou,, goin,, put that as an output of yours in Tekoa,, So for now, can you create A or of their dumb with you?. You take Ecoute Likin dictionary, You in, work on that for you to I. And and you would want that all in one file for all the Coppers, or for for the serious,, But I call the series.. I can also deal with separate files in Maine rites, The outbreak that it O in the retrorsome thing,, But I mean there, I can directly put it.. so if you can put it in one single magafile, that would be quite useful for me.. So only words am per meeting, sir... even for you, wouldn't it be as if you had different fights Because any sort of no, No, if for me it's very fine, so give me.. give me different files as long as I, if you could name them in a way that is easy to enumerate over them like whatever,, one, two, three for five, or something... at anything that I can.., Yes, they will so well estate over the names Savenaye is.. Is there something they easily elated to enumerate over a itemsome ordered pattern to one series is same t tussock.., Yes, so only words and words as no.., I don't need the time.. Suggest need the words,, but I and the right or ye... You want a one?. O K., I hear any man here with lit orders.. I'm a best at times and don't Yes,, Sometimes they're contained in one another, so antedate mutes of when do you think you'll have a leg of primitive segmentation by some ready made topic?. Se, by some ready made tool ready... I mean to Eleanor Caseine,, How kak as I need that ten men in a Oakham, I think Em for all the corps is just for what I know, for my attempts at em.., nine magamie bite to have means that Peter should be similar to Licorice... words, words, he na, other words together, am other meetings.. That sounds quite reasonable... That's nine nine characters guessing over now am what I, because nine megabates is what I got for when I said for ere I'm utterance.., This A goes from that to the N.. Let us say, or are we?. are we thinking one particular serious at the moment or I'm doing it for it, is it here... I guess we can re the data for different series and then check which serious is the best for the presentation... It sounds quite reasonably and make about me.. If you think if it's roughly a million words and nine character Ivy words, I had little will be the same for the word is just what.., I. Now, Yes, I'm going to build a dictionary then, from that like just a list of the words that may be a list of the words with the frequencies, or a list of the words sorted alphabetically or numerically.. But what does any one want to it?. Any wishes for dictionaries?. I could see at a torrent.., I think until the information density instead be red, so I'll create a dictionary.. So am I properly sent em... just one file of permeating, I'm to all those who need it so that it can ever looked at the stranger, and then the actual file became probably copy from your home directly, or somthnli.. it... I mean, it's just for one teniente, but Im sir, I'm saying for the whole thing.. in the end, I lintieing pole shouldn't do by E. How long would it take to make a anaiteuor from the time I get the file can do that in an often, the next or the next morning... Oh, you mean how long processing time it takes on how long you would have to be.. It is box and irate, Iv.., five, sort of.., I've written it for for dill jus in half an hour or something similar... jest, He put them in a hash table, and and say, well, if it exists already in the hash table, they need C the count by one... and I've probably implement some falter for filtering out n u or so something, because it's quite easy in pale line of coat for counting all the words.. and really, I must be by ass... Mark you were... I don't know any poleman If any one wants to do a postscript.., For that he does it nicely.. I, I've no problem for that, but I think I have the job coat virtually ready, because Padilla wrote something very similar like Padilla wrote something that counts there... The different occurrences of all the taxes.. Have you doing it in Java?. Do you and cried?. Alas is writing it to file, Sir,. If you dingan Java serialized at the ashtable as well as writing it to file, Er, never serialized them really easy... Wouldn't that be absolutely master,, or Don't see what'd be any more Asianfile and then Cyrilla,, and then write the cyrilization to a Ile E. So you want like a, like a file, which is the cyrilization of a hatesyaa.., T,, part fine representation of it in.. No,, I'll be eating it in Java... Anyway, Shall just be building date structure again.. I'll I'll check if I understand how it works.. I mean, otherwise, I can give you the coat for loading a dictionary... A. it's just it's it's.. It's a line break separated finally, or seems like a bit silly to by passing over and over again.. A ye, yea.., I see if I understand how to serial ise There's there's a serial as Commander,, That gives me one magamother of the sort.. Er.. I think all the collections and things in Pevensey Blalready here, but do they automatically write to the file anyway?. I'll figure that out, take point of view.., Yes, that pretty much pretty much it... So Dave and me look at how night a smell works, and we're all trying to oesework to Morrow, to tide to it or to old.., I think I'll build a dictionary as soon as I get the text.. and yes, that when do we have to meet again?. Then the.. suppose that one or anon, or how are we going to do a demonstratinext week?. we have to demonstrate some.. what do I denono'?. not demonstrably?. Didn't you say that, but didn't we sort of agree that it would be useful to have a demonstrator of like some primitive thing working like I suggested.. The ha prototype has got to be very prototype of a aimeri.., I gain more in... now let's go.. I feel like like hanging in mid air and not really like finding a point where you can get your teeth into it and start working for the air, and it's all so fuzzy though ink is cos., We had to specify it ourselves that it's no likie specification of vice on you, but at the moment, but at the moment it as an Imp imitation, a level I, with the data structures in us, like over these vague ideas of some treason.. Once we start doing it will become more so.. It's just our half way through the project time to be, which just freaks me out.\"]\n"
